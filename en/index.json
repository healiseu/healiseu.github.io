Hatzis, PhD","type":"authors"},{"authors":["Athanassios I. Hatzis, PhD"],"categories":["Application_programming_interface"],"content":"Table of Contents  Why HyperMorph  Not just another ETL tool Not only a data storage and transformations-analytics tool More promising than data virtualization and cloud analytics services   Speechless HyperMorph Screencast  Hypermorph speaks for itself Now you know that you can \u0026hellip;   Installation - Demo Test - Documentation  Step by step instructions Demo Guide to Test package Documentation     Why HyperMorph Not just another ETL tool There are many open-source tools written in Python for ETL or ELT process, petl, bubbles, mara-pipelines, mara-schema, bonobo, luigi, odo, etlalchemy, mETL, riko, carry, locopy, etlpy, pygrametl. Authors in many of these tools realized that Python developers need a uniform interface based on object oriented abstractions for commonly used operations.\nWell-designed powerful OOP classes HyperMorph offers interactive console programming and development with high-level OOP components tailored to cover all aspects of database management and analytics. HyperMorph is very rich in that aspect and provides DataSet, Table and Field classes for data resources, DataModel, Entity, Attribute classes for data models, SchemaGraph, SchemaNode, SchemaLink, SchemaPipe classes for metadata management, DataGraph, DataNode, DataLink, DataPipe for data management, Connector class for python drivers/clients and at the highest level of management we have ASET (Associative Entity Set is similar to Relation) and HACOL (HyperAtom collection).\nSchema and data as objects and nodes on a hypergraph HyperMorph goes one step ahead of the OOP design principle. It creates objects with 3D numerical vector identities and links them as nodes on a hypergraph. That graph is powered by graph-tool one of the best and fastest network analysis tools in Python. Hypermorph keeps separate schema information, i.e. metadata, from stuctured data (tuples, hierarchical, graph, table, etc). This unique feature offers the possibility to organize easily data resources and to build complex customised data models in order to digest data. Data integration (consolidation) requires to manage successfully the complexity of mapping data resources on a data model something that can be easily done when our objects are hypergraph enabled and have numerical key vectors to identify their exact location in the schema, data graph.\nHyperMorph Connectors Another fundamental difference of HyperMorph with ETL tools is on the Python DB Driver/Adapter side. The current release supports:\n Clickhouse-Driver MySQL-Connector SQLAlchemy with the following three dialects  pymysql clickhouse sqlite    On top of these drivers HyperMorph uses a Connector class to abstract and unify SQL command execution sql() in a functional way and wrap commands to extract metadata get_tables_metadata(), get_columns_metadata(). Transformation to tuples, json rows, tuples, columns, and pyarrow batch/table is taking place at this level. At this stage performance is a critical factor. In our design and implementation of HyperMorph connectors we are seeking to minimise the time delay and data transferring speed. Therefore the protocol of communication that is used in the python database driver/adopter is highly important.\nPipelines This is a standard approach in ETL frameworks and a very useful one because in general pipelines are flexible and intuitive in programming. Hypermorph is not an exception we tried to make a difference here by designing same pipeline operators for fetching either data or metadata. For example there is an over() operator for projection and to_dataframe() for transformation to Python Pandas dataframe. We have even wrapped functional commands on pipelines so that you can choose between OOP (chaining) or functional style of programming.\nNot only a data storage and transformations-analytics tool There is another category of tools related with data storage (in-memory, on-disk), transformations and analytics processing, such as TileDB, datatable, pandas, petl, vaex, pytables, ibis, numpy, dask, pyarrow, gandiva. Usually most of them construct a table data structure in-memory or on-disk and use either a column layout or row layout to process the data. Hence they resemble database engines. In fact previous prototypes of HyperMorph (see TRIADB project) were based on SQL database engines. This time the current, first, release of HyperMorph is powered by PyArrow. There are many reasons for that choice. Most important PyArrow is mature and provides a columnar memory format for flat and hierarchical data, organized for efficient analytic operations on modern hardware including GPUs. But regarding HyperMorph the killer feature of PyArrow package is dictionary encoding which is utilized to implement associative filtering, part of our associative semiotic hypergraph technology, in the style of Qlik analytics engine.\nMore promising than data virtualization and cloud analytics services In recent years there is also another approach for data management and analytics aiming to skip the weary ETL process. Usually these are SaaS products on the cloud, such as panoply, dremio, knowi, denodo, and many others. They provide GUIs and act as middleware between DBMS and BI platforms. Naturally these are proprietary products and details on how they work under the hood are hidden. Developers or power users have to stick with menu-widget driven interfaces than having the ultimate flexibility of programming at the level of Python language. You may consider HyperMorph as an open-source API with the same role to fetch data for graph visualisation platforms. HyperMorph has three key differentiating points here data consolidation, user defined data modeling and interactive associative filtering for analytics with the option to visualize connected data on a graph. And because HyperMorph is open-source it is more promising that potentially our technology can be used from many software vendors for BI applications.\nSpeechless HyperMorph Screencast Hypermorph speaks for itself Watch the demo, check youtube settings and make sure video quality is at 1080p HD. You may also set the playback speed at 0.75 to increase the time of executing commands.\n  Now you know that you can \u0026hellip; and the only limit on what you can is your imagination.\nInstallation - Demo Test - Documentation Step by step instructions on how to install release.\nDemo Guide to Test package Demonstration of HyperMorph functionality on data resources and demo scripts that are included in the distribution.\nDocumentation A draft of the documentation from comments in source code is generated automatically with Sphinx and it is hosted at GitHub.\n","date":1598054400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598054400,"objectID":"78c6544fd0bcf7ff5b08b930c1452e63","permalink":"https://healis.eu/en/project/hypermorph/","publishdate":"2020-08-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/project/hypermorph/","section":"project","summary":"Operational Python API for information management and data transformations-analytics on Associative Semiotic Hypergraph Development Framework","tags":["Programming","Software","Python_(programming_language)","Application_programming_interface","Database","Database_management_system"],"title":"HyperMorph","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1597881600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597881600,"objectID":"fca1b5df6e2d85d93c391ba49d81426c","permalink":"https://healis.eu/en/hmorph/","publishdate":"2020-08-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/hmorph/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"HyperMorph","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1597536000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597536000,"objectID":"8576ec274c98b3831668a172fa632d80","permalink":"https://healis.eu/en/about/","publishdate":"2020-08-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/about/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"About","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1597536000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597536000,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://healis.eu/en/contact/","publishdate":"2020-08-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Contact","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":["Athanassios I.

It’s main unique and valuable characteristics are:\n Interactive visual exploratory analytics powered by TriaClick associative semiotic hypergraph engine. The technology is based on ClickHouse columnar DBMS and its output can be easily transformed to enable hypergraph traversal, associative selection and cross-filtering with states on coordinated visualizations.   TRIACLICK Animated Chart  Coordinated update of GUI components based on associative selection and filtering    TRIACLICK Hypergraph  Visualization of hypergraph paths based on TRIACLICK associations   User defined business models in the form of a hypergraph. Data modeling plays a central role in TRIADB. Management of meta-data, loading and filtering processes are innately related, associated, with the business model you define.   Business Model Graph  Business model based on Northwind database with Associative Entities in yellow   Interactive programming with high-level OOP components and methods tailored to fit database management and analytics. TRIADB powerful transformations, including list items, tuples and associations enable the user to analyze data quickly and intuitively.   Associative Filtering  Examine visually how the domain set values of attributes are related    Transformation of aggregation  Aggregation in a filtered state and transformation to tuples and bar chart   What problem TRIADB solves and how The project started long time ago from a personal need to integrate an electronic medical record database used in a neurosurgery clinic with several other specialized databases for neurosurgical disorders. Integration, correlation, aggregation and visual exploration will always be the holy grail of business analytics. Associative technology in general is a specific solution that has not been opened to the public until now although it is applied by one of the most successful BI companies for two decades. The implementation of associative semiotic hypergraph engine (TRIACLICK) in TRIADB project opens a path for other competitive, cost effective (not only RAM based), efficient solutions sharing the same principles in data modeling and database management.\nFuture Plans TRIADB is a middleware, one part is closely coupled with the physical layer of the data store engine and the other part is closer to the application layer. Therefore the project can be expanded in two directions, optimization and improvement of associative semiotic hypergraph engine on one hand, efficient and effective transformations and visual exploration on the other hand.\nIn spite of the growing development of TRIADB which requires urgently funding for resources, the critical factor for the success of this project is how exactly it is going to be applied to solve particular users’ problems. This step requires that users become aware of what are the advantages in using TRIADB and what they can achieve.\nCross-References  LinkedIn - 20191025 Pulse Article - TRIADB v0.9  ","date":1571961600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571961600,"objectID":"ad943073ad6bd99994ed8c7b753b5131","permalink":"https://healis.eu/en/post/20191025/","publishdate":"2019-10-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/post/20191025/","section":"post","summary":"Second release of TRIACLICK on ClickHouse and MariaDB DBMS","tags":["Programming","Software","Application_programming_interface","Database","Database_management_system","associative_semiotic_hypergraph","Associative_model_of_data","Database_model","MariaDB","ClickHouse","Python_(programming_language)","Hypergraph"],"title":"TRIACLICK 2nd Release","type":"post"},{"authors":["Athanassios I.

Visit HyperMorph the successor of this project   Introduction TriaClick is my long standing effort to revitalize Relational and Topic Maps data model. Associative filtering, similar to Qlik associative engine, has been implemented for the first time with a fast columnar DBMS on non-volatile memory and tested with a relatively large file on commodity hardware.\nScreencast Screen Capture Demo of TriaClick, a python library that implements associative, semiotic, hypergraph technology on top of ClickHouse columnar DBMS and MariaDB. We show the execution of commands from two python console applications that are built with TriaClick library. The various operations (methods) of our Chain Query Language (CQL) aim to make the processing pipeline of data integration, exploratory data analysis and visualization easier, faster, intuitive, and more efficient and accurate for the database/data analyst expert. Currently the focus is on management of data resources and data models, associative filtering, hypergraph exploration and aggregations.\n  Performance On my 10 years old Intel i3 core machine, TriaClick takes about a minute to load a 42 x 2.8M Physician records TSV flat file (856MB) on SSD and the average elapsed time for processing user selections, i.e. filters with an exploratory QlikView style, is 3 seconds. Output can be transformed and seen as associations, tuples, and columns with distinct values, frequencies and filtering states. The result set can also be driven to a hypergraph for further exploration.\nCross-References  LinkedIn - 20190211 Pulse Article - TriaClick Demo  ","date":1549843200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1549843200,"objectID":"f05b411770a544e4a3a3cc9896a8776b","permalink":"https://healis.eu/en/post/20190211/","publishdate":"2019-02-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/post/20190211/","section":"post","summary":"First release of TRIACLICK on ClickHouse and MariaDB DBMS","tags":["Programming","Software","Application_programming_interface","Database","Database_management_system","associative_semiotic_hypergraph","Associative_model_of_data","Database_model","MariaDB","ClickHouse","Python_(programming_language)","Hypergraph"],"title":"TRIACLICK 1st Release","type":"post"},{"authors":["Athanassios I.

Visit HyperMorph the successor of this project   At A Glance TRIADB is an innovative, multi-perspective database framework. It is a Python library that sits on top of suitable NoSQL/SQL data store engines and enables the users to perform easily integration, correlation, aggregation and hypergraph exploration of multiple data resources. TRIADB is founded on the principles of R3DM/S3DM.\nArchitectural Design In terms of the architectural design TRIADB is based on associative, semiotic, hypergraph technology pioneered by Dr. Athanassios I. Hatzis. Foundational principles, theoretical formalization and ontological dimensions of the framework and the data model are dating back to the year 2012. Our technology shares certain similarities with Qlik associative technology, AtomicDB and X10SYS associative technology, Sentences associative data model, Topic Maps data model and correlation database model. The main difference of our technology from other similar associative technologies is that it has a solid theoretical background, a unified data modeling architecture and at the same time it is distinct in its design and implementation.\nArchitectural Overview (White Paper) It seems that your browser cannot display the PDF file; Please use this link  instead. Thanks!   Implementations There are four TRIADB prototypes implemented:\n TRIADB on OrientDB with Mathematica - 2016 TRIADB on Intersystems Cache with Python - 2017 TRIADB on Redis with Python - 2018 TRIADB on MariaDB and ClickHouse with Python - 2019  In the last open-source release of TRIADB, MariaDB stores data dictionary information and ClickHouse data storage engines are used for processing and querying data. The associative, semiotic, hypergraph engine has a proprietary licence, although the sources are included in the release, and it is given the codename TriaClick.\nConference Presentations  16/11/2017 - Connected Data London Conference 19/06/2017 - European Wolfram Technology Conference in Amsterdam  Key Differentiating Factors The following is a list of technical specifications and features in the design and implementation of TRIADB. This same list is what makes TRIADB a unique and valuable product:\n Multi-Perspective Database Framework: tuples, domain sets, objects, hypergraph, hierarchical Act both as an operational and data warehouse database with a 360 degree view Automatic fixed, primary indexing schema instead of user-defined secondary indexing Manage the references instead of data: relying on reference-based associations and logical identifiers No duplicates: single value instance based on system defined primitive data types Consolidation of multiple data resources and mapping on user-defined data models Management of data resources, data models and metadata Python Chain Query Language (CQL) that avoids namespace and impedance mismatch problem Interactive, free-form, contextual queries  Business Strategy We create strong partnerships with database vendors to implement and fine-tune TRIADB on top of their technology stack and we offer consulting services on how to apply Associative, Semiotic, Hypergraph technology. We are not selling licenses or software, we provide full stack solutions and add-on value for our own clients, or for the clients of the vendor, thus the system we build inherits the scaling, performance, availability and TCO of the vendor.\nOur associative, semiotic, hypergraph technology is open-source. We are seeking for developer\u0026rsquo;s community consensus on the use of it and we strongly believe that our technology will be eventually adapted by major semantic and database technology players in the IT industry.\nCross-References  LinkedIn - 20190211 Pulse Article - TriaClick Demo LinkedIn - 20190319 TriaClick Architectural Overview White Paper LinkedIn - 20191025 Pulse Article - TRIADB v0.9  ","date":1549843200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1549843200,"objectID":"b9f843d64c5b3d694a8c1fa89f9a2037","permalink":"https://healis.eu/en/project/triadb/","publishdate":"2019-02-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/project/triadb/","section":"project","summary":"Data Management \u0026 Analytics Python API enables users to perform easily integration, correlation, aggregation and hypergraph exploration of multiple data resources","tags":["Programming","Software","Wolfram_Language","Application_programming_interface","Database","Database_management_system","associative_semiotic_hypergraph","Associative_model_of_data","Qlik","Topic_map","Correlation_database","Database_model","OrientDB","Redis","MariaDB","ClickHouse","Python_(programming_language)","InterSystems_Caché","Filter_(higher-order_function)","Serialization","Hypergraph","Computational_semiotics"],"title":"TRIADB","type":"project"},{"authors":["Athanassios I.

And without realizing it, I have just discovered, that I was always working from the inside out but I could not articulate why until now.\nInformation technology is a tool that can be used in many ways, but perhaps the most creative and imaginative aspect, is to view IT as the vehicle for communication. In that case IT covers a basic human need, arguably a need that can be even more important than food. And communication in Greek is ΕΠΙ-ΚΟΙΝΩΝΙΑ, literally meaning, on top of society.\n Man is by nature a political animal 1\n Relations and Communications You can easily see what one can achieve with a computer, but deep behind this behavior is the why part of it. Take internet for example, you can educate yourself, you can learn about something new, you can interact with systems and services, you can be creative. This is definitely a form of communication. But it is more direct when you become a member in a social media site, or in a forum, or in a programming/game community. And the reason behind all these user actions is that we need to communicate. We need customers to serve, we need an audience to perform, we need others to share things, we need to be in a group of people. We are internet citizens, citizens of this world.\nThe question is would you travel around the world without any navigation system ? Same question is true for internet. It is the search engine and the hyperlinks that play partly the role of a map and a compass. But nowadays these are not enough. It\u0026rsquo;s because we have started asking to get meaning, to find value out of our data. We want to understand not only how but why things are interconnected. Therefore we should use technology, the know how, to build meaningful, valuable relationships and lay them down as a foundation to establish effective communication. And in my opinion, and opinion of great inspired leaders you have to think, act and communicate from inside out. It is not the product that defines the need, it is the need that dictates what is the product. This is the right guide in the design and implementation of inter-operable systems, devices and applications.\nWe see things differently In HEALIS this is our philosophy and also our brand strategy to develop great solutions to fully cover your needs and the needs of your customers. A humble start was made with TRIADB. Although TRIADB is not a product for the common end-user, it reflects our way of thinking about information technology in general.\n   Here\u0026rsquo;s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They\u0026rsquo;re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can\u0026rsquo;t do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do 2\n We have laid strong foundations, we put the cornerstone at the right place. We made a start and we can see the future of this.

The event brings together top class innovators, thought leaders and practitioners in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Semantic Technology.   Unfortunately the light conditions were not ideal for the demonstration of our system. We recommend you visit the links at the right side of the following table to view Pandas notebooks in addition to the video above. You may also start the video at the corresponding time.\n   Time Pandas Notebook     05:00 Traversal and Hypergraph   09:00 Hypernodes, Hyperedges and Tuples   11:45 Hypercollections   13:00 Data Model   15:30 Mapping    Slides of the talk  Screen Captures           The first two images of our collection portray a hypegraph of seven records, two on the left (Parts), three in the center (Catalog Entries) and another two on the right (Suppliers). The main difference is that in the first one nodes are shown with values and in the second one with 2D numerical references. Images are aligned so you can switch back and forth with the left and right arrow keys.\nThe third image shows execution of TRIADB Python commands on a Jupyter notebook. This is a traversal query that fetches the tuples that make the neighbourhood of the two parts that we saw in the first two images.\nIn the fourth image two records are drawn, they have common values for the weight and the name of the part. There is a red (partID=993) and a silver (partID=994) Acme Widget Washer but they do not share a common unit for the weight. This cleansing problem is solved in the fifth image where the two parts share three common values.\nThe sixth image visualizes the bipartite mapping solution. The fields on the left are mapped onto attributes on the right and the pandas 2D frame in the seventh image presents their names and key references.\nFinally the last two images display a hypergraph data model for movies and a movie instance with many participants. Again you can switch back and forth with the left and right arrow keys.\nVideo Screen Capture of TRIADB Screencast of TRIADB on a toy problem dataset with a junction table (Catalog) that bridges the other two tables (Supplier and Part). Videos demonstrate in detail the python client API functional operations of TRIADB system such as add models, add resources and records, get operations to retrieve data and hypergraph traversal operations.\nThere are five videos in this playlist of HEALIS youtube channel. You may start watching the last video of this series to get an overall impression of TRIADB\nPart 1/5 In this recording session we demonstrate the first Jupyter Notebook. We show how to use TRIADB functional commands to reset and rebuild the framework. And we explain a bit the associatve and semiotic architectural design of our framework.   Part 2/5 In this video you will learn how to add a data model, how to search and retrieve information from the data model environment of TRIADB framework and how to visualize your data model.   Part 3/5 In this video we continue with adding resources, mapping these resources to the data model and finally adding records into TRIADB.   Part 4/5 In this video we continue with GET operations on Supplier-Part-Catalog data set and we describe various environments according to S3DM/R3DM data model. These include the Data Types Environment (DTE), Data Values Environment (DVE), Data Resources Environment (DRE), Data Models Environment (DME) and Data Sets Environment (DSE).   Part 5/5 In this video, first we explain the hypergraph visual representation of our data model, then we compare it with relational data model and finally we traverse the hypergraph.

In this framework semantics are defined and explained with three alternative paradigms (object-oriented, network graph and semiotics). It is the last one that gives birth to its name and this is also the cornerstone of its reference mechanism. R3DM/S3DM redefines RDBMS as a Reference Database Management System with a set of functional operations that match those of SQL statements and are implemented in Wolfram Language.\nBased on these operations we demonstrate interactively using Wolfram Notebook interface how we can create R3DM/S3DM environment on top of OrientDB Graph Database and how we can add a Domain Model or a Data Set. We also present R3DM/S3DM filtering mechanism for traversing and cleansing and we compare and review these command operations in Qlikview graphical user environment.\nThe output of this interactive exploration of data modeling, processing and analysis and any result set can be returned in the form of a table using Wolfram Language constructs such as List(s), Rule(s), Association(s) and Dataset(s).

These are the naming of predicate terms that connect resources and literals and the unidirectional architectural design of the edges. We have already demonstrated this issue with the associative model schema design of a Movies domain in Freebase, Fig.10, and the modeling of our Supplier-Parts-Catalogue toy example in Sentences, Fig.15, Fig.16 and OrientDB Property Graph, Fig.4. In this post we continue our journey with Qlik\u0026rsquo;s associative data model.\nQlik\u0026rsquo;s In-Memory Associative Architecture Qlik\u0026rsquo;s competitive advantage over other BI tools is that it manages associations in memory at the engine level and not at the application level [(English,2010)]1. This management of data, is deep down to an atomic level of data (Granularity), i.e. every data point in every field of a table is associated with every other data point anywhere in the entire schema [(English,2010)]1. We will follow Qlik\u0026rsquo;x QIX engine stepwise approach with the goal of performing an interactive data exploration [(Ferguson,2015,p.10)]2 of our Suppliers-Parts-Catalogue data set.\nLoading the data The first step is to bring data into memory. A multi-table read-only, in-memory, compressed, binary, columnar data model is created. Data from each source data table is converted into two types of in memory data structure : [(Ferguson,2015,p.12)]2.\n A set of columns that contain binary values, i.e. references, for each distinct original value. A compressed binary data table by replacing each row/column cell value with a binary reference.  For example, the following statements, [QlikView script syntax, p.242]3, load data from the Parts and Suppliers tables that are stored in Excel files and reconstruct eleven unique columns and two read-only binary representation of these tables in memory.\nLOAD prtID, prtName, prtColor, prtWeight, prtUnit FROM [F:\\tmp\\SupplierPartCatalogue\\SuppliersPartsCatalogue.xlsx] (ooxml, embedded labels, table is Part); LOAD supID, supName, supAddress, supCity, supCountry, supStatus FROM [F:\\tmp\\SupplierPartCatalogue\\SuppliersPartsCatalogue.xlsx] (ooxml, embedded labels, table is Supplier); If two fields have the same name in two different tables (i.e. a relationship) then they have the same columnar binary representation. In order to resolve ambiguities and to associate over fields that have the same name, unique column naming is required. This is the case for our third associative, i.e. bridge, junction table. Field names catSID and catPID have already been loaded and represented with the columns supID and prtID. The next LOAD statement is using the alias operator (as) to handle unique column naming.\nLOAD catSID as supID, catPID as prtID, catPrice, catTotal, catDate, catChk FROM [F:\\tmp\\SupplierPartCatalogue\\SuppliersPartsCatalogue.xlsx] (ooxml, embedded labels, table is Catalogue);   QlikView Internal/Source Table View   Once the script is executed we can review the data table structure, Fig. 1, with the Table Viewer. The three tables are associated with two connectors that bidirectionally link them through their common fields. This layout is quite similar with the Entity-Relationship diagram of Microsoft Access database schema, Fig.5. A QlikView association resembles a SQL natural outer join. However, an outer join in SQL is unidirectional. An association always results in a full (bidirectional) linkage. In practice we have two completely different approaches. In a typical SQL join query we repeatedly search the index because of the join condition.\n QlikView associative engine (QIX) knows how every data point is associated, therefore it can effectively determine (infers) and flag all distinct column values and all rows in each data table upon user\u0026rsquo;s selection 2\n The Blind Spot Depending only on memory, QlikView can load many whole tables without joins, instead of a limited view from the main dataset. Other query-based BI tools usually aggregate an extracted subset of data and return it in the form of a result set. This result set is completely divorced from the original data set and this very act of extraction breaks associations. For example, find out how a piece of data contained in a query relates to another piece of data outside the query [(QlikView Whitepaper, October 2010, p.3)]4. You may think also of an internal combustion engine analogy . With the query-based paradigm, we would look at individual parts of the engine in isolation, (see the header image of our post). Using QlikView associative technology, we have access to a digital model of a complete working engine and we can tweak any part to see how that affects other parts and the engine on the whole.\nExplore/Filter Data via Selections In this section we will examine QlikView associative aspect from the user\u0026rsquo;s experience point of view. \u0026ldquo;Central to QlikView is the concept of a user-defined selection state. As users click around in a QlikView document, they indicate which subsets of data they are interested in analyzing and which subsets should be ignored, [(QlikView Whitepaper, September 2011, p.10)]5. To demonstrate the visual effect of associations, i.e. the relationship between a value in one field and a value in another, we arranged a number of [Sheet Objects, p.457]3 in our Main worksheet. We chose [Table Boxes, p.507]3 to present rows of data from our Tables and [List Boxes, p.459]3 to display a list of all possible values of a specific field. We have also added a [Current Selections Box, p.519]3 to list user\u0026rsquo;s selected field values and a [Search Object, p.569]3 for searching for information anywhere in the document, Fig.2.\n    QlikView Sheet Object in an unselected state with Table Boxes, Current Selections, and a Search Box on the left side and a Container with List Boxes for Fields representation on the right side   Now you can see visually what is associated and is not associated with any particular selection. For instance, [Fig.3]3 displays the state of our Worksheet when the user selected the Part item with ID value equal to 998. The List Box of the field (prtID) with the value 998 appears in green and it has also been added to the Current Selections list. In other List Boxes, unrelated values in all other fields appear in gray and those that are related appear in white. At the same time, when the user interacts with this particular List Box all the rows of Table Boxes are instantly filtered to reflect this new context.\n    Table Boxes on the left side are filtered and values of the List Boxes on the right appear in white or gray according to the current selection (green)   So far we have seen how we can get the resulting data after user\u0026rsquo;s selection in two possible formats, a list of values (List Box) for each field of the data Table, Fig.5, and a grid (Table Box) with tuples (records), Fig.4. You may also notice in our visual setup that we have a Derived Relation red grid with selected fields from all three Tables of our data set. This grid is automatically constructed with those tuples that appear in the other three grids (Catalogue Table Box, Part Table Box and Supplier Table Box). We should make it clear that the update of this Derived Relation under the hood is not performing any kind of Join (SQL) operation. The effect of tuples filtering and shading of list values is demonstrated with animated gif images in three states. There is the Unselected State, then there is the Part with ID value 998 selected state, and from those Catalog entries for this specific Part, (4 entries, one for each Supplier), we select the Supplier with the minimum Catalog price and that is our third state.\n    Animated Grids of Tuples       Animated Lists of Values from Table Fields   R3DM Hypergraph Representation With the Associative Data Modeling there can be a third way to present data. This is the one that engages the user with the visualization of network graphs. In the previous post of our series, we have drawn an R3DM Hypergraph, Fig. 14, and we described associations according to R3DM terminology. We have used exactly the same data of this case study example, i.e. find the **Supplier** with the minimum Catalog** price for Part** with prtID value 998, to draw Fig.2 , Fig.3 , Fig.4  and Fig.5 . This time we have redrawn hypergraph of Fig. 14 with the help of OrientDB Graph Editor, Fig.6. Every string label and numerical value of Fig. 14 has been replaced with a unique OrientDB record identifier, (RID - clusterID : clusterPosition). In effect, this is how we implemented R3DM/S3DM Sign layer. Each data item becomes an Atomic Information Resource (AIR) unit with a symbolic representation of a 2D vector (Entity/Attribute Type : Instance).\nAIR Units From Data Items in any structure (Table/Entity/Triple/JSON/XML) to data model reconstruction with Information Atoms\nAIR units can represent in a uniform way anything, i.e. Entities, Attributes, Values, Types, Databases, etc. Their vector form can be indexed, linked, retrieved, stored efficiently, and we can use AIR units to build associations and assimilate composite information structures such as records (tuples).\nTo visualize R3DM associations using AIR units we have color coded the graph and we added a legend at the left side, Fig.6. Entities are distinguished from attributes by the size of the disk and grouping of entities and attributes is depicted with different shades of a color (green for Suppliers, brown for Parts, purple for Catalog items). We can easily see four Catalog items (#70:7, #70:11, #70:12, #70:16) associations with the four Suppliers (#68:0, #68:1, #68:2, #68:3) and the Part (#69:7) with ID value 998 (#77:7) that is drawn in the center of the graph with the black disk around it. USA suppliers (#68:0, #68:1) share the value of their common supCountry attribute (#75:0). One of them (#68:1) has a Catalog entry (#70:11) with the minimum catalog price,catPrice, (#82:9). We can also see the formation of tuples for Supplier (4), Catalog (4) and Part (1).\n    R3DM Color Coded Associations with AIR units   Regarding to the immense advantage of using AIR units to reconstruct hierarchical, table, or graph structures, we can also refer to the following QlikTech patent. In the \u0026ldquo;Summary of the Invention\u0026rdquo; section we read:\n each different data element value of each data element type is assigned a binary code and the data records are stored in binary-coded form. On account of the binary coding, very rapid searches can be conducted in the tables. - Qliktech International AB Patent, May 20016\n Future Plans It is rather unfortunate that the basis of QlikView\u0026rsquo;s evolutionary associative technology has been confined to the market of proprietary software products. In HEALIS we have made the difference by opening up these database design key principles for discussion with experts of the field and we have made them part of our R3DM/S3DM conceptual framework.\nWe have gone a step further to implement our framework on top of OrientDB and Intersystems Cache DBMS and instead of writing SQL queries, we have abstracted the programming of a set of functional operations that match the selection and filtering of data. We plan to continue with the last part of this post series in order to fully demonstrate how we build our system and how we test it with the Suppliers-Parts-Catalogue data set.\nCross-References  LinkedIn - Published Posts LinkedIn - Semantic Web Research Group LinkedIn - Graph Databases Group LinkedIn - Data Warehouse \u0026amp; Business Intelligence Architects LinkedIn - Computational Semiotics LinkedIn - Semantic Technologies LinkedIn - Data Visualization LinkedIn - Database \u0026amp; Data Store Professionals ★ NoSQL ★ NewSQL ★ Relational LinkedIn - Database Developers and Architects Group LinkedIn - Linked Data Web LinkedIn - Update LinkedIn - Database Experts LinkedIn - QlikView Qlik Community - German User Group - Post Qlik Community - Discussion    D.

Hatzis, PhD"],"categories":["Semantic_Web"],"content":"Table of Contents  Introduction to RDF RDF and Linked Data Association in RDF Associative Model Association in R3DM Discussion Acknowledgements Cross-References   Introduction to RDF In the previous post, Part-3, of this series we explored the Property Graph data model. It is now time to write about another Graph data model with a long history behind it, the Resource-Description-Framework (RDF). We will see how we can define an association in RDF and what are the differences with other data models that we analyzed in previous posts of our series.\nRDF is a graph-based data model that has been designed to represent information as a labeled directed graph. In RDF, a description of a resource, i.e. any type of thing, is represented as a number of triples. Each triple has a subject, predicate, and object. Alternatively if you want to think in terms of Entity-Relationship model, these three parts of the triple become the Entity-Attribute-Value. This is also known as the EAV model. For instance the Entity subject Part:998 of our Parts table in the example data set of our series can be serialized in Turtle syntax as :\nPart:998 rdf:label \u0026#34;Fire Hydrant Cap\u0026#34;@en ; schema:color \u0026#34;Red\u0026#34;@en ; schema:weight \u0026#34;7.2\u0026#34;^^xsd:double ; schema:unitText \u0026#34;lb\u0026#34;@en ; dc:identifier \u0026#34;998\u0026#34;^^xsd:int . These rdf:label, schema:color, schema:weight, schema:unitText, dc:identifier are attributes of this Entity instance and \u0026ldquo;Fire Hydrant Cap\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Red\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;7.2\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;lb\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;998\u0026rdquo; are atomic values with an accompanied data type, see also Fig. 7.\nRDF and Linked Data But RDF is not like any other data model, it has been selected from W3C as one of the Web technologies, together with HTTP and URIs, to extend the hyperlinking of documents to a set of best practices for publishing and interlinking structured data on global scale. Today the term Linked Data refers to these standards, and the extension of the Web is also known as the Semantic Web. The predecessor of RDF, the Semantic Network Model, was formed in the early 1960s. The main difference is that arcs and nodes in RDF are identified using HTTP URIs and dereferenced (i.e., looked up) over the HTTP protocol. If we use N-Triples syntax to serialize the same resource Part:998 we take:\n\u0026lt;http://example.org/spc/Part/998\u0026gt; \u0026lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#label\u0026gt; \u0026#34;Fire Hydrant Cap\u0026#34;@en . \u0026lt;http://example.org/spc/Part/998\u0026gt; \u0026lt;http://schema.org/color\u0026gt; \u0026#34;Red\u0026#34;@en . \u0026lt;http://example.org/spc/Part/998\u0026gt; \u0026lt;http://schema.org/weight\u0026gt; \u0026#34;7.2\u0026#34;^^\u0026lt;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#double\u0026gt; . \u0026lt;http://example.org/spc/Part/998\u0026gt; \u0026lt;http://schema.org/unitText\u0026gt; \u0026#34;lb\u0026#34;@en . \u0026lt;http://example.org/spc/Part/998\u0026gt; \u0026lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/identifier\u0026gt; \u0026#34;998\u0026#34;^^\u0026lt;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#int\u0026gt; . Notice that the object part of the triple is an RDF literal and datatypes are used to represent values such as strings, numbers and dates. These triples are called Literal triples and describe the properties of resources. In our example these literal triples describe five properties of the Part:998 resource. This type of RDF triples is distinguished from the other type which is RDF Links and describe the relationship between two resources. For example if we want to express with the same syntax all the vendors of Part:998 we will form these triples:\n\u0026lt;http://example.org/spc/Part/998\u0026gt; \u0026lt;http://www.wikidata.org/property/hasVendor\u0026gt; \u0026lt;http://example.org/spc/Supplier/1081\u0026gt; . \u0026lt;http://example.org/spc/Part/998\u0026gt; \u0026lt;http://www.wikidata.org/property/hasVendor\u0026gt; \u0026lt;http://example.org/spc/Supplier/1082\u0026gt; . \u0026lt;http://example.org/spc/Part/998\u0026gt; \u0026lt;http://www.wikidata.org/property/hasVendor\u0026gt; \u0026lt;http://example.org/spc/Supplier/1083\u0026gt; . \u0026lt;http://example.org/spc/Part/998\u0026gt; \u0026lt;http://www.wikidata.org/property/hasVendor\u0026gt; \u0026lt;http://example.org/spc/Supplier/1084\u0026gt; . This is also the equivalent result set at Fig. 1 presented in a compact form from the following SPARQL query:\n#Suppliers of Part 998 PREFIX Supplier: \u0026lt;http://example.org/spc/Supplier/\u0026gt; PREFIX Part: \u0026lt;http://example.org/spc/Part/\u0026gt; PREFIX xsd: \u0026lt;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\u0026gt; PREFIX wd: \u0026lt;http://www.wikidata.org/property/\u0026gt; PREFIX dc: \u0026lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\u0026gt; select ?prt ?p ?sup where { BIND(wd:hasVendor AS ?p) # Start with a ?prt that has id=998 ?prt dc:identifier \u0026#34;998\u0026#34;^^xsd:int . # Find all catalog items (?cat) with a reference to ?prt ?cat wd:hasPart ?prt . # For any catalog item (?cat) find the vendor that supplies ?prt ?cat ?p ?sup . }     Result set from SPARQL query to find the suppliers of Part:98   In Fig. 1 The URI with QName wd:hasVendor, in the predicate position defines the type of relationship between a subject with QName Part:998 and an object with any of these QNames (Supplier:1081, Supplier:1082, Supplier:1083, Supplier:1084). Both subject and object URIs are in the same namespace (http://example.org/spc/), these are called Internal RDF links.\nOne way to think these RDF links is as a labeled directed graph. Each triple is a directed arc that connects a subject, e.g. Part:998, with an object, e.g. Supplier:1084, and the predicate is the label of the arc, wd:hasVendor. For example the previous result set can be represented with the following graph in Fig. 2:\n    Suppliers of Part:998   But the graph for the data model of our example is slightly more complicated because there are intermediate nodes, i.e. inventory items that represent records from the Catalog table, that associate, bridge Suppliers with Parts Fig. 3.\n    Suppliers of Part:998 with intermediate Inventory Items nodes   Another distinction of RDF links to Outgoing and Incoming can be seen in Fig. 3. For example Part:998 has four incoming RDF links of type wd:hasPart and Item:7 has two outgoing RDF links of type wd:hasPart and wd:hasVendor respectively.\nIn fact the SPARQL query above has been written taking in consideration this graph. In order to traverse the nodes you must know both the type of RDF link and its direction. In RDF graph data model edges are unidirectional. In order to define bidirectional edges we have to define both outgoing and incoming RDF links for each node, i.e. two predicates Fig. 4.\n    RDF bidirectional   Association in RDF We can now compare these five associations of Part:998 with RDF links of the graph in Fig. 6. One of them is composed with all outgoing triples of Part:998, i.e. Part:998 is the subject of the triple Fig. 5. These literal triples describe five properties of Part:998 resource, yellow boxes of Fig. 6, and another RDF link is for the type of resource, i.e. Item (grey box).\n# Get all outgoing triples for a specific part PREFIX Part: \u0026lt;http://example.org/spc/Part/\u0026gt; select ?prt ?p ?o where { BIND(Part:998 AS ?prt) ?prt ?p ?o . }     Result set of all outgoing triples for Part:998   The resource Part:998 participates in four associations with Inventory resources, as the object of a triple. These are the four incoming RDF links of Part:998 in Fig. 3, Fig. 6 and Fig. 8.\n    Five associations of Part:998, four with the green boxes and one with the yellow boxes   We can write the following SPARQL query to ask for all the suppliers of Part:998 sorted by their catalog price.\n#Suppliers of Part 998 (Red Fire Hydrant Cap) sorted by their catalog price PREFIX xsd: \u0026lt;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\u0026gt; PREFIX wd: \u0026lt;http://www.wikidata.org/property/\u0026gt; PREFIX schema: \u0026lt;http://schema.org/\u0026gt; PREFIX rdf: \u0026lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\u0026gt; PREFIX dc: \u0026lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\u0026gt; select ?sup ?supName ?supCountry ?catPrice ?catQuantity ?prt ?prtName ?prtColor ?cat where { # Start with a ?prt that has id=998 get its name and color values ?prt dc:identifier \u0026#34;998\u0026#34;^^xsd:int . ?prt rdf:label ?prtName . ?prt schema:color ?prtColor . # Find all catalog items (?cat) with a reference to ?prt get their price and quantity values ?cat wd:hasPart ?prt . ?cat schema:cost ?catPrice OPTIONAL {?cat schema:quantity ?catQuantity .} # For any catalog item (?cat) find the vendor that supplies ?prt get their name and the country of origin ?cat wd:hasVendor ?sup . ?sup rdf:label ?supName . ?sup schema:country ?supCountry } ORDER BY ASC(?catPrice) You may consider the analogy between this query and the result set at Fig. 7 and the equivalent OrientDB SQL query and the result set from a Property Graph data model. The main differences are that in Property Graph data model you can traverse edges in both directions, (incoming, outcoming), the filtering part (where) in SPARQL is significantly longer, and the starting point is represented in a different manner (edge vs link).\n    Suppliers of Part 998 (Red Fire Hydrant Cap) sorted by their catalog price       Associations of Part:998 with Suppliers and their Catalog prices   We can view a graph representation, Fig. 8, of this SPARQL query and its result data set Fig. 7. In the same screen capture, Fig. 8, a many-to-many relationship is modeled with RDF triples. Supplier:1082 is associated with three parts (Part:991, Part:997 and Part:998) and Part998 is associated with four suppliers (Supplier:1081, Supplier:1082, Supplier:1083, Supplier:1084), see also Fig. 9. From a semantic point of view, Parts and Suppliers participate in associations with Inventory items (green boxes - Catalog:7, Catalog:9, Catalog:10, Catalog:11, Catalog:12 and Catalog:16). In contrast with the binary relations between Suppliers and Parts represented with directed edges in a Property Graph, see here, instead of an edge type we have explicit intermediate (bridge) nodes and instead of outgoing head (out) and incoming tail (in) we have two outgoing directional links (wd:hasPart and wd:hasVendor) from this intermediate node, e.g. Catalog/Inventory item to Supplier and Part. In such as case these outgoing directional links (wd:hasPart and wd:hasVendor) look like roles in a Topic Map binary association.\n/* 4 Associations of catalog part no 998 with supplier Ids and catalog prices */ Catalog07( Part998:HasPart, Supplier1081:HasVendor, 11.7:Cost ) Catalog11( Part998:HasPart, Supplier1082:HasVendor, 7.95:Cost ) Catalog12( Part998:HasPart, Supplier1083:HasVendor, 12.5:Cost ) Catalog16( Part998:HasPart, Supplier1084:HasVendor, 48.6:Cost )     A Many-to-Many Relationship between Suppliers and Parts modeled with RDF triples   Associative Model Although it has not become mainstream, we see associative model of data as an effort to enhance RDF data model in a new kind of DBMS. The logical layer of Sentences associative database management system may be regarded as comprising of only two tables: one for Items that represent Entities, Entity Types, Values and Value Types and one for Links that represent among other things Associations and Association Types ([Fig. 15], [Fig. 16]). Both Items and Links also represent meta-types and instances, which perform various functions in the database. Thanks to this simple consistent form of Items and Links, it is easy to write generic code that is capable of working with every type of data. Recording schema changes and transactions, a type system [Fig. 15], associative queries in the form of a request tree, business rules, data provenance, automated default data entry forms [Fig. 16] and many other features of Sentences DBMS were designed and implemented based on this generic metacode programming.\n    Types, Association Instances and their Properties       Types, Entity Instances and Data Entry Forms   In fact along similar principles Freebase collaborative knowledge base, now known as Google\u0026rsquo;s Knowledge Graph, was serving its users.\nBoth Freebase and Sentences added also reverse edges to their model. In Freebase notation, [Fig. 10] we can see that /film/film is /directed_by a /film/director and a /film/director has directed (/film) a /film/film.\n    Movies Data Model in Freebase   Bidirectional links allow a 360° view of every data item in the database. Directed edges in Property Graph share the same concept, see here. In the following three figures (Fig. 11, Fig. 12, Fig. 13) we present three alternative schema views for our Supplier-Part-Catalog database that we built on Sentences DBMS. Fig. 11 illustrates that it is possible to add attributes on the link. Fig. 12 shows that Supplier, Catalog and Part entities are sharing common attributes while in Fig. 13 they are directly connected with bidirectional links.\n    Association in R3DM According to R3DM Hypergaph Terminology, the objects of RDF literal triples, i.e. values, are HyperAtoms and the resources of RDF links are HyperBonds. Thus the RDF graph of Fig. 8 can be redrawn as a hypergraph with red nodes that play the role of HyperAtoms and green nodes that play the role of HyperBonds, see Fig. 14.\n    R3DM Hypergraph   This R3DM hypergraph figure above, Fig. 14, has been created from the execution of the following Wolfram Language code. You will notice that HyperAtom sets such as ha2-(catcost) and ha5-(catqnt) are attribute sets with value members that take part in the formation of Catalog records with instances that are drawn from hb2 set. Supplier instances are drawn from the other HyperBond set (hb3) and ha3-(sname), ha4-(scountry) are attribute sets with value members that describe the Suppliers. Instances from these HyperBond sets may share common values or associated with the same HyperBond. For example we have two suppliers, Supplier:1082 and Supplier:1081 that are located in USA or Catalog:11 and Catalog:16 entries that are associated with Part:998 and they both have the same quantity, i.e. 200 pieces of this part.\nha1={998,\u0026#34;Fire Hydrant Cap\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;Red\u0026#34;,7.2`,\u0026#34;lb\u0026#34;}; ha2={11.7,7.95,12.5,48.6}; ha3={\u0026#34;Acme Widget Suppliers\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;Big Red Tool and Die\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;Perfunctory Parts\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;Alien Aircaft Inc.\u0026#34;}; ha4={\u0026#34;USA\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;USA\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;SPAIN\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;UK\u0026#34;}; ha5={\u0026#34;400\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;200\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;200\u0026#34;}; hb1={\u0026#34;Part:998\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;schema:item\u0026#34;}; hb2={\u0026#34;Catalog:7\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;Catalog:11\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;Catalog:12\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;Catalog:16\u0026#34;}; hb3={\u0026#34;Supplier:1081\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;Supplier:1082\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;Supplier:1083\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;Supplier:1084\u0026#34;}; vstyle=Join[Thread[Join[ha1,ha2, ha3,ha4,ha5]-\u0026gt;Red],Thread[Join[hb1,hb2,hb3]-\u0026gt;Green]]; data=Join[ {\u0026#34;Part:998\u0026#34;-\u0026gt;\u0026#34;schema:item\u0026#34;}, Thread[\u0026#34;Part:998\u0026#34;-\u0026gt;ha1],Thread[hb2-\u0026gt;ha2], Thread[hb2-\u0026gt;hb3],Thread[hb3-\u0026gt;ha3], Thread[hb3-\u0026gt;ha4],Thread[hb2-\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Part:998\u0026#34;], Thread[{\u0026#34;Catalog:7\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;Catalog:11\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;Catalog:16\u0026#34;}-\u0026gt;ha5]]; Graph[ data, VertexLabels-\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Name\u0026#34;, VertexSize-\u0026gt;{{\u0026#34;Nearest\u0026#34;,0.15}}, VertexStyle-\u0026gt;vstyle, EdgeShapeFunction-\u0026gt;GraphElementData[{\u0026#34;CarvedArrow\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;ArrowSize\u0026#34;-\u0026gt;.02}], EdgeStyle-\u0026gt;Thick, GraphLayout-\u0026gt;\u0026#34;SpringEmbedding\u0026#34;, ImageSize-\u0026gt;{400.,Automatic} ] We can rewrite now the following four associations :\n/* 4 Associations of catalog part no 998 with supplier Ids and catalog prices */ CatalogID( catpid, catsid, catqnt, catcost) Catalog07( Part998, Supplier1081, 400, 11.70 ) Catalog11( Part998, Supplier1082, 200, 7.95 ) Catalog12( Part998, Supplier1083, 12.50 ) Catalog16( Part998, Supplier1084, 200, 48.60 ) Associations in this form greatly resemble tuples of Catalog relation, see TSV format, where the heading of this relation is usually stored in a data dictionary and Null marker indicates that a data value is absent from the tuple. On the contrary in case of RDF literal triples the predicate position signifies the object part of the triple and in RDF links Instances/Type of resources at subject and object positions are also signified by predicates such as (rdf:type). But in R3DM associations there is not any label on the edge that connects HyperAtoms or HyperBonds. Therefore the denotation of resources and literals, i.e. what they stand for, cannot be seen on this graph, Fig. 14. For example in Catalog12 association instance we have to know that the literal meaning of the value 12.5 is the Catalog Cost. Generally speaking, this is the granularity of data problem. How we represent a piece of information at atomic level and how we construct higher structures. R3DM/S3DM unifies three perspectives, semantics at the conceptual layer, representation at the symbol layer and encoding at the physical layer, in such a way that they are separable. R3DM/S3DM conceptual framework is based on the natural process of semiosis where the signified, i.e. concept, entity, attribute and the signifier, i.e. value, are referenced through symbols, i.e. signs, at discrete layers. The main difference with RDF data model is that these references are not in the form of URIs but they resemble IPs. For example the value 12.50 can be referenced by a 4D vector of the form {2, 8, 262, 1} where the first dimension is the database, the second dimension is the table (Entity), the third dimension is the field (Attribute) and the last dimension is a member of an attribute set.\nDiscussion Although this is not the space or the time to elaborate more on R3DM/S3DM associations it is important to mention that it is possible to escape from the predicate logic (owl#sameAs) on how to identify that two URI aliases refer to the same entity. Moreover the alternative paradigm of R3DM/S3DM offers a more attractive and efficient approach on data integration and heterogeneous data representation than bridging between RDF vocabularies with mapping predicates such as owl:equivalentClass and owl:equivalentProperty.\nWe foresee that the Internet of things will use a protocol with numerical reference vectors for data communication in a similar fashion to IP addresses that are used for connecting devices in a computer network. Hopefully one day it will become clear that the predicate part of RDF data model is causing more harm than good in the semantic interpretation and information representation.\nLast but not least, SPARQL query mechanism is heavily dependent on namespace vocabulary terms, especially predicate terms that connect resources and literals. To answer such queries, care must be taken to devise a suitable mechanism of indexes (e.g. spo, sop, pso, pos, osp, ops) to support RDF triple structure. Besides indexing, RDF edges by default are not bidirectional, therefore 360 degrees view and nodes navigation is problematic. In contrast with RDF, in R3DM/S3DM everything is bidirectionally linked and referenced with 4D numerical vectors and these are naturally used for indexing purposes. Instead of writing queries there is a functional way, i.e. you learn a single command with a standard number of optional or mandatory parameters, to filter the data space and retrieve any piece of information.\nInteractive and associative data exploration is the key, unique feature of Qlikview/Qliksense, one of the best data visualization and business intelligence software in the market today. Behind the scenes, columnar, binary indexing capability is the foundation for QIX Associative Data Indexing Engine. In the next part of our series we will apply Qlik associative technology on our toy dataset and we will demonstrate how we build the domain model and how we filter our data.\nAcknowledgements We have serialized our Supplier-Part-Catalogue example in Turtle and N-Triples syntax. Then we used AllegroGraph and GraphDB triple-store to create a repository and run queries on their SPARQL interfaces. All graph-based images of this article were displayed and captured on Gruff, an RDF visual browser that displays a variety of the relationships in AllegroGraph.\nCross-References  LinkedIn Published Posts LinkedIn Semantic Web Group LinkedIn Graph Databases Group LinkedIn Data Warehouse \u0026amp; Business Intelligence Architects LinkedIn Computational Semiotics LinkedIn Semantic Technologies LinkedIn Data Visualization LinkedIn Database \u0026amp; Data Store Professionals ★ NoSQL ★ NewSQL ★ Relational LinkedIn Database Developers and Architects Group LinkedIn Linked Data Web LinkedIn Mathematica Users LinkedIn Database Experts DZone Article  ","date":1482192000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1482192000,"objectID":"0baa31630eb04d4da144308919bbed13","permalink":"https://healis.eu/en/post/20161220/","publishdate":"2016-12-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/post/20161220/","section":"post","summary":"Part 4/6 of the series Associative Data Modelling Demystified","tags":["Semantic_Web","Topic_map","Sign_(semiotics)","Triangle_of_reference","Signified_and_signifier","Associative_model_of_data","Data_model","Semantics","Database","Database_management_system","Graph_database","associative_semiotic_hypergraph","Computational_semiotics","Associative_entity","Resource_Description_Framework","Association_(object-oriented_programming)","Serialization"],"title":"Association in RDF Data Model","type":"post"},{"authors":["Athanassios I.

In this article we continue our investigation with the Graph Data model. Despite its mere representation as nodes and edges, the structure of this model and its implementation details varies a lot in Graph Databases. There is still a strong controversy and perhaps confusion on what makes a database, a Graph database and many are not fully aware that there exist other types of Graph Databases apart from Property Graph Database. Things get more complicated because the engine of a Property Graph Database is not the same kind of engine with either an RDF store or engines based on Topic Maps or Relational data model. Property Graph data model is neither close to Object Model, a data model that is found in Object-oriented database management systems. There are significant differences of the Property Graph data model at both the logical and the physical level with all other models and it has not been established yet as a standard. Which brings us to the question whether there is indeed a necessity for another data model standard based on the association construct to fill the space of Property Graph databases and bridge also the gap with other Semantic Web technologies, especially JSON for Linking Data. This question will not be answered in this post, we will make an attempt instead to give a formal definition of the association construct using the mighty Wolfram Language and compare it with RDF and Property Graph components and this will prepare also the ground for introducing our R3DM data model later on.\nWolfram Language EntityPropertyAssociation Real-world entities are another kind of symbolic expression that exists in latest versions of the Wolfram Language. You can get the values of specific properties for an Entity, if it exists in Wolfram Knowledgebase, world\u0026rsquo;s largest and broadest repository of computable information according to Wolfram. But you do not write a query to fetch the data, you use a functional approach instead. The network delay for a first time search on specific values of EntityProperties is minimal. For example:\nSocrates=Entity[\u0026#34;Person\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;Socrates::dnz7w\u0026#34;]; EntityValue[ {Socrates}, {gender,date of birth,place of birth,parents,children}, \u0026#34;EntityPropertyAssociation\u0026#34;] Notice the third argument of the EntityValue function here, EntityPropertyAssociation will format the output, Fig. 1, of this calculation as an association in which the specified entity is the key, and value is another nested association of properties and EntityProperties values.\n    Wolfram Language EntityPropertyAssociation   A boxed word is the symbolic Wolfram Language Knowledge Representation of a named entity of any type, (e.g. Person, City, Property), that is used as a handler to access records of information about that Entity that are stored in Wolfram Knowledgebase. The reader should realize how important this symbolic representation is in data modeling. Although the developer/user may compute a solution with a boxed CommonName, e.g. Socrates, behind the scenes a canonical name, e.g. Socrates::dnz7w, is used as the unique identifier for the Entity to disambiguate and to interpret user\u0026rsquo;s instructions.\nThis EntityPropertyAssociation representation extends Wolfram Language fundamental Association construct, and it is in accordance with Topic Map Association serialization that we discussed in the second part of our series. The following figure, Fig. 2, is from a previous example that is included in Part 1 of our series and depicts three associations of this kind in a Wolfram Dataset. Each association represents an Entity type instance ($PartI, $SupplierJ and $CatalogK) and for each instance the entity type ($Item, $Organization, $Inventory) is embedded as a key value pair together with other EntityProperties key-value pairs.\n    Three Associations in a Named-Row Dataset   Contrast this with mere tuples from the three tables of our relational database, Supplier, Part, Catalog. Semantically speaking, the three tuples cannot stand alone without the header of the relation body and their relation type. In addition to that observation, each value of either an EntityPropertyAssociation or member of a tuple, is always dependent on their sibling nodes. Therefore values cannot be handled in isolation.\n{ {998, \u0026#34;Fire Hydrant Cap\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Red\u0026#34;, 7.2, \u0026#34;gr\u0026#34;}, {1081, \u0026#34;Acme Widget Suppliers\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;1 Grub St., Potemkin Village, IL 61801\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ILLINOIS\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;USA\u0026#34;, 10}, {1081, 998, 11.7, 400, \u0026#34;2014-9-10\u0026#34;, True} } R3DM Hypergraph Terminology     A Hyperbond hyperlinked to HyperAtoms   The figure on the left, Fig. 3, illustrates a single EntityPropertyAssociation of Part no. 998 with its properties and values. According to Hypergraph theory, red nodes are hypernodes and the green node is the hyperedge where here connects a set of hypernodes. In R3DM we use the following definitions and terminology.\nAn EntityPropertyAssociation can be defined as an Association of entity\u0026rsquo;s attributes (properties) with values. Each attribute-value pair is represented on the hypergraph by a hyperatom. Therefore the general form of a hyperatom is a key-value pair. Each hyperatom is always connected bidirectionally to a hyperbond with a hyperlink. Normally hyperlinks do not have labels or direction. A hyperbond represents a complex structure, such as a tuple of a relation or instance of a class. The role of a hyperbond is to connect a set of hyperatoms. A hyperbond to hyperbond connection is also possible.\nTwo important observations:\n  You can easily spot similarities between R3DM hypergraph paradigm and JSON documents. A JSON object can be represented with a hyperbond and a field-value pair (property) can be represented with a hyperatom.\n  Entities, attributes (variables), and values each has its own type system in R3DM. These type systems will be analyzed methodically in another post but you can get a taste of what they look like here.\n  Property Graph We defined EntityPropertyAssociation and we got familiar with the terminology of R3DM hypergraph. We can now proceed to examine the analogy with the Property Graph data model.\nRecall that a property graph has vertices and edges where :\n  each vertex has\n a set of outgoing edges. a set of incoming edges.    each edge has\n an outgoing tail vertex. an incoming head vertex. a label that denotes the type of relationship between its two vertices.    vertex and edge have\n a unique identifier a collection of properties defined by a map from key to value.    We built a property graph data model for our Supplier-Part-Catalog example in OrientDB, a very popular, open-source, and free multi-model database.\nProperty Graph Nodes OrientDB allows both schema-full and schema-less creation of classes. Each class represents either a type of nodes or a type of edges on the graph. In the manner of a relational schema, we can add properties of a class with OrientDB SQL commands.\nCREATE CLASS Part EXTENDS V; CREATE PROPERTY Part.pid INTEGER; CREATE PROPERTY Part.pname STRING; CREATE PROPERTY Part.pcolor STRING; CREATE PROPERTY Part.pweight DOUBLE; CREATE PROPERTY Part.punit STRING; ALTER CLASS Part SHORTNAME P; Then we can populate the class with records, e.g. create a vertex (an instance of type Part) that represents Part no. 998 (Red Fire Hydrant Cap)\nCREATE VERTEX Part CONTENT {\u0026#34;pid\u0026#34;:998,\u0026#34;pname\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Fire Hydrant Cap\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;pcolor\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Red\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;pweight\u0026#34;:7.2,\u0026#34;punit\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;lb\u0026#34;} Property Graph with Directed Edges Now comes the tricky part, we want to associate Suppliers with Parts. Notice that in Property Graph data model there is not an associative entity to resolve a many-to-many relationship. We only have the concept of a directed edge that links one vertex with another vertex. Let us define the type of edge first.\nCREATE CLASS inCatalog EXTENDS E; CREATE PROPERTY inCatalog.catsid INTEGER; CREATE PROPERTY inCatalog.catpid INTEGER; CREATE PROPERTY inCatalog.catprice DOUBLE; CREATE PROPERTY inCatalog.catqnt INTEGER; CREATE PROPERTY inCatalog.catdate DATETIME; CREATE PROPERTY inCatalog.catchk BOOLEAN; ALTER CLASS inCatalog SHORTNAME C; In this OrientDB DDL inCatalog.catsid and inCatalog.catpid are superfluous, we added them for comparison purposes with the relational model. Records of edge type inCatalog contain record identifiers for the outgoing tail vertex and the incoming head vertex Fig. 11. Secondly, it is not specified in the schema that this type of edge, inCatalog, connects Suppliers with Parts, neither is specified any direction on how to link these two types. These are defined during the creation of an edge.\nOne way of creating inCatalog instances is to read each Catalog record from the table, get OrientDB record identifiers (RIDs) for the specific Supplier and Part and then execute OrientDB CREATE EDGE SQL command to create a bidirectional edge. For example:\nCREATE EDGE inCatalog FROM #19:0 TO #18:7 CONTENT {\u0026#34;catsid\u0026#34;:1081,\u0026#34;catpid\u0026#34;:998,\u0026#34;catprice\u0026#34;:11.7,\u0026#34;catqnt\u0026#34;:400,\u0026#34;catdate\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;2014-09-10\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;catchk\u0026#34;:true} Newcomers can easily get confused with Property Graph edges. This is because although the outgoing tail and the incoming head of the edge implies a directed graph, in practice we can traverse the graph bidirectionally, i.e. start from any node to reach another node independent of the direction of the edge.\n    A Many to Many Relationship on a Property Graph   In this screen capture, Fig. 4, of OrientDB graph canvas one Supplier is associated with three Parts and one Part is associated with three Suppliers. We observe that inCatalog edges are always from a Supplier to a Part. This is because we created edges this way, we could have created them equally in the opposite direction. Semantically speaking, both Supplier and Part participate in a Catalog association and their binary relation is not directed. In such a case Property Graph edges look like Topic Map binary associations. The label of the edge is the type and the roles of its members are played by the outgoing head (out) and incoming tail (in), Fig. 5.\n    Directed Bidirectional Edge   Property Graph with Bidirectional Links Hence the bidirectional nature of the edge can be seen in two ways.\nFirstly the out and in links can be considered as one-to-one relationship of an edge with vertices. One Supplier/Part is referenced by Many Catalog items. The fields that are linked are the RID of Catalog with the RID of Part or Supplier, Fig. 11. This type of direct linking is similar to the many-to-many relationship with a join-table, Fig. 6.\n    Many-to-Many relationship with direct links on Associative Entity (edge)   Secondly, on the one side of the relationship, i.e. on the vertex we have the link set of outgoing/incoming edges, Fig. 8 and Fig. 9. For example, many Catalog items (LinkSet) have One Supplier/Part, Fig. 7.\n    Many-to-Many relationship with sets of direct links   The following query returns a list of both the outgoing edges for Big Red Tool and Die Supplier, see Fig. 4, and the list of associated Parts, Fig. 8.\nselect @rid As Supplier, out_inCatalog as Catalog, out() As Part, sid As supplierID, out().pid As partID, scountry, scity from 19:1     Set of Outgoing Edges for Supplier   In a similar fashion, we can ask for the list of incoming edges to Part no. 998, see Fig. 4, and the list of Suppliers that provide that Part, Fig. 9\nselect @rid As Part, in_inCatalog as Catalog, in() As Supplier, pid As partID, in().sid As supplierID, pname, pcolor from 18:7     Set of Incoming Edges for Part   The set of outgoing edges from the Supplier and the set of incoming edges to Part no. 998 have a common edge, 17:11, that connects this Supplier with this Part, see Fig. 4.\nProperty Graph and Object-Oriented database We could have implemented bidirectional edges on top of OrientDB Document data model using Link, Link list, Link set data structures and the CREATE LINK SQL command. If you take also into account its class inheritance, schema-full, and SQL methods features, that brings us pretty close to the object-oriented database model. Objects, in turn, may reference one another and therefore form a network graph. A relationship, in particular, is an association between two persistent objects, each of a specific type. In Intersystems Cache, relationships are binary, i.e. defined between two classes and bidirectional, i.e. both sides of a relationship must be defined by creating a pair of complementary relationship properties, one in each class. Two-way reference property in both classes, collection in \u0026ldquo;one\u0026rdquo; side and simple reference in \u0026ldquo;many\u0026rdquo; side are analogous to the link set of outgoing/incoming edges in a vertex and the out/in links in edge of Property Graph data model, Fig. 8, Fig. 9, Fig. 11.\nAssociation vs Edge If we take these \u0026ldquo;Three Associations in a Named-Row Dataset\u0026rdquo;, Fig. 2, and create a graph with analogy to the Property Graph data model, we can see that $PartI (green node), $CatalogK (red edge), and $SupplierJ (blue node) are hyperbonds, i.e. they are EntityProperty associations and they are connected with hyperlinks i.e. undirected bidirectional links, [Fig. 10].\n    Three Hyperbonds connected with Hyperlinks   There are three main advantages using R3DM hypergraph instead of a Property Graph:\n  There is a uniform treatment of records for both entities (nodes) and associative entities (edges). In R3DM these are symbolically represented by hyperbonds. Hyperlinking hyperatoms or hyperbonds is not the same as connecting property nodes with property edges.\n  Entities, attributes and values are completely separable. There is not an Entity-Attribute neither an Entity-Attribute-Value \u0026lsquo;Silo\u0026rsquo; structure. This will become clear at a later post on the associative characteristics of R3DM. Here it is enough to say that the collection of properties defined by a map from key to value are enclosed in the structure of property graph node/edge. On the contrary in data models such as RDF, Topic Map and our R3DM hypergraph each key-value pair (hyperatom) can be a single instance and the same value can be linked to more than one classes (hyperbonds) or instances of the same class, see the discussion here\n  Under the hood, in a Property Graph each regular edge between two nodes creates another record. You cannot link one node record directly to another node record, you must always cross the edge record either from its tail or from the head. But with a hyperlink things are different, you do not need to load any edge record to resolve the other part of the relationship, no edge document is created. Thankfully, OrientDB provides such a data structure, it is the Lightweight Edge. We have implemented R3DM in OrientDB using Lightweight Edges and it will be fully described in an upcoming post.\n  Join vs Edge Now, examine this relational database sql query here with the following comparable OrientDB Property Graph query:\n/* Suppliers of a Red Fire Hydrant Cap sorted by their Catalog price */ select out as supRID, out.sname as supName, out.scountry as supCountry, catprice as catPrice, catqnt as catQuantity, in as prtRID, in.pname as prtName, in.pcolor as prtColor, @rid as catRID from inCatalog where in.pid=998 order by catPrice     Suppliers of a Red Fire Hydrant Cap       Suppliers of a Red Fire Hydrant Cap on OrientDB Graph Canvas   This OrientDB SQL query is clearly more compact and with a faster performance, because there are no JOIN operations anymore. We can get back the result set represented with a Wolfram Dataset structure, Fig. 11. Instead of having supplier IDs and part IDs, these are now replaced with OrientDB record IDs (RIDs). We have also added another column at the end which is the RID of the edge record, i.e. Catalog record.\nCheck also this Topic Map graph representation. The main difference is that these Catalog relationships and the Part tuple are drawn explicitly on the Topic Map and all values of properties are visible on the same graph. In this Property Graph, Fig. 12, only one of the enclosed properties of any node or edge type is displayed.\nSummary We can summarize the critical points of our investigation in Property Graph data model:\n We introduced R3DM Hypergraph as the harbinger of R3DM associations. R3DM hypergraph is based on Wolfram EntityPropertyAssociations and extends Property Graph with hyperbonds that represent in a uniform way nodes and edges; while hyperatoms are hyperlinked to hyperbonds and are analogous to a property-value pair. From this perspective:   There is not an Entity-Attribute or Entity-Attribute-Value \u0026lsquo;Silo\u0026rsquo; structure. Hypelink, i.e. bidirectional edge without a record, can link directly hyperatoms to hyperbonds and hyperbond to hyperbond   In all the data models we have described so far in our series, every value is accessible only by knowing its context. Thus far, values are either dependent on a relation variable and attribute in a Relational model, or they come as field-value pairs in the object of a Document model / Object-Oriented model, or you have Topic Type and Topic Roles in Associations of Topic Map model, or they form property-value pairs that are enclosed in the node structure of Property Graph model. Even in the triplets of RDF model, that we will examine in the next article, you have an entity-property-value context.\n  Generally speaking, in Property Graph data model schema specifications for Node and Edge types are weak and it is not easy to define referential integrity and handling of many-to-many relationships. OrientDB object-oriented features alleviate that problem.\n  In a Property Graph data model edges are always directed but we can traverse them in both ways, i.e. they link bidirectionally nodes of the graph. In this sense, the label of the edge is comparable to the Topic type of a binary association in Topic Map data model; whereas, the labels out and in that signify the outgoing head and incoming tail are the roles of its members.\n  In object-oriented database model, it is possible to represent Property Graph edge with a two-way reference property in both classes, collection in \u0026ldquo;one\u0026rdquo; side and simple reference in \u0026ldquo;many\u0026rdquo; side.\n  There are no JOIN operations in Property Graph data model. The edge record associates each half of the relationship with direct links.\n  We will examine separately RDF data model, one of the W3C standards for the Semantic Web. From our perspective, RDF and Property Graph are in conflict for reasons that we will discuss in the next article of our series. It seems the rivalry of these two data models is in succession of an older one between RDF and Topic Map.\nCross-References  DZone Article LinkedIn Published Posts LinkedIn Topic Maps Community Group LinkedIn Graph Databases Group LinkedIn Database \u0026amp; Data Store Professionals Group LinkedIn MUMPS and Cache Development Group LinkedIn Mathematica Users Group LinkedIn OrientDB Users Group LinkedIn Semantic Web Research Group  ","date":1473724800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1473724800,"objectID":"584a07134e62ec6ca34b4e74b93978da","permalink":"https://healis.eu/en/post/20160913/","publishdate":"2016-09-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/post/20160913/","section":"post","summary":"Part 3/6 of the series Associative Data Modelling Demystified","tags":["Semantic_Web","Topic_map","Sign_(semiotics)","Triangle_of_reference","Signified_and_signifier","Associative_model_of_data","Data_model","Semantics","Database","Database_management_system","Graph_database","associative_semiotic_hypergraph","Computational_semiotics","Associative_entity"],"title":"Association in Property Graph Data Model","type":"post"},{"authors":["Athanassios I.

In this post we demonstrate how Topic Map data model represents associations. In order to link the two we continue with another SQL query from our relational database\nSELECT suppliers.sid, suppliers.sname, suppliers.scountry, catalog.catcost, catalog.catqnt, parts.pid, parts.pname, parts.pcolor FROM suppliers INNER JOIN (parts INNER JOIN [catalog] ON parts.pid = catalog.catpid) ON suppliers.sid = catalog.catsid WHERE (( ( parts.pid ) = 998 )) ORDER BY catalog.catcost;     This will fetch all the rows of a result set where we are looking for the minimum catalogue price of a Red Fire Hydrant Cap and who is the supplier that manufactures this part. The reader will notice that apart from the deficiensy of the nested JOINs, (see here), we had to formalize our search in SQL language in order to get back our result. Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be nice if we could engage the user in a codeless style of search, independent of the business case. Let us see the difference with the Topic Map data model first.\nAssociations in Topic Map Data Model Perhaps there is not a better software tool out there to introduce you to Topic Maps than Wandora information management application, see how.\nTuples to Associations Our first step is to build a Topic Map data model from the SQL result set above. With Wandora this is easy thanks to its powerful set of extractors. Here we use an Excel adjacency list extractor to convert each spreadsheet row of this Excel file to a Topic Map Association.\n    Tuples of a Relation - Wandora Associations   In the right panel of the screen capture, you may see that we have four associations of type Tuple. They are all sorted by the catcost column. This is the role that cells of this column play in the Tuple association. In our example each Tuple is an instance of the Excel class with a maximum of 8 members and each member plays a role in the association. You may agree that this Topic Map model view of data looks already very familiar to the user that is accustomed with tables.\nBut behind the scenes Topic Map associations are notably different from the n-ary tuples of the relational model. In the left panel of our screen capture you can see all the data that are extracted from the spreadsheet. Notice that no data value is repeated. Each association is constructed from single instance values and this also means that associations are sharing values among them. We can visualize the network of associations by switching to Wandora\u0026rsquo;s Graph topic panel. From the left panel, we select the minimum price of the part, which is 11.7 and then we expand this node on the Graph topic panel. This way the first association will be drawn that includes as members all the other values that this cell is associated with. One of them is USA and plays the scountry role. We can right click on the value and expand again the nodes (associated members). Two associations are displayed now on the graph that share four common values between them.\n    Two Associations in the Graph Topic Panel of Wandora. Brown labels indicate the type (Tuple) of association and the role (sname) of one of its members   SQL to Topic Map Filtering Another important observation we should make at this point is that instead of writing any query to fetch those suppliers that are located in USA we simply filtered the table based on this value. We are able to do this, because Topic Map data model works with single instance values that are linked bidirectionally. Accordingly, data is always normalized and the main operations of the relational algebra such as set operations, selection and projection, can be performed. For instance, filtering associations that have USA member is equivalent to selecting rows from SQL. Moreover, the user can traverse interactively the graph starting from any value without writing a single line of code.\nTopic Map Serialization To understand better the underlying structure of data in the previous example, we have serialized a Topic Map in LTM format. Dropping this LTM file into an empty topic panel, we invoke the import function of Wandora. Then we expand the topic tree and double click on the 998 cell. The following screen capture looks pretty much the same as the one we have generated from extracting the Excel spreadsheet above. The main difference is that now we have two association types, one for Catalogue tuples and another for Part tuples. Part 998 participates in five associations (tuples) in total, four of them are from Catalogue table and one from Part table. We have also taken a minimum number of members, i.e. fields (columns), for our associations to keep it simple.\n/* 1 Association of catalog part no 998 with \u0026#34;Red\u0026#34; and \u0026#34;Fire Hydrant Cap\u0026#34; */ Prt( prtName08:pname, prtID08:pid, prtColorRed:pcolor ) /* 4 Associations of catalog part no 998 with supplier Ids and catalog prices */ Cat( prtID08:catpid, supPrice18:catcost, supID18:catsid ) Cat( prtID08:catpid, supPrice14:catcost, supID14:catsid ) Cat( prtID08:catpid, supPrice16:catcost, supID16:catsid ) Cat( prtID08:catpid, supPrice12:catcost, supID12:catsid )      Associations of part no. 998   Because of the single instance feature of Topic Maps, If we switch to Wandora\u0026rsquo;s Graph topic panel we can visualize these associations.     Associations of part no. 998   R3DM Type System in Wandora We expand our previous example with tuples from three tables and a rich type system, also known as Ontology or database schema.\n    Associations of part no. 998, Supplier Associations and Symmetric Binary Predicates   We start again our exploration from the data item with the value 998. There is one association, labeled Part8, representing a tuple from Part table (998, \u0026ldquo;Fire Hydrant Cap\u0026rdquo;, Red, 7.2, lb) and four of them, labeled Cat08, Cat12, Cat13, Cat17, representing tuples from the Catalogue table (see result set above). Further on, USA suppliers are expanded with two more associations, labeled Supplier1 and Supplier2. The two previous graphs are combined in a single one. We can also observe other associations with only two members, we call these symmetric binary predicates (SBP). SBPs are used to define a prototype for our R3DM type system. For example, the member value 7.2 of association Part8 is of type Part Weight (Instantiation Predicate) and Part Weight is hyponym of Weight (HyperHypo Predicate). The reader may compare this graph with this Entity-Relationship diagram and realize that we have both instances (values) and classes, i.e. Entities and Attribues, on the same graphics diagram. Not only that, but most important our type system is generic and we are able to merge and classify data from multiple datasets. Alternatively, Wandora\u0026rsquo;s Topics tree panel on the left part of the image displays a hierarchical structure for types and instances. Those that are expanded can also be seen on the graph panel.\nThis is a good place to introduce our R3DM type system. It is presented here for the first time and it will be fully analyzed in a forthcoming post of this series. In the next graph we have expanded several nodes of our hierarchical type system. For instance, Catalogue, Catalogue Part, Catalog Supplier are represented as groups (Grouping Predicate) of Wandora class which is the Root of the Topic Tree. Each of these groups is also a type (Instantiation Predicate) for a set of instances that represent associations. We have Cat01-16 for Catalogue associations, Part1-9 for Part associations, and Supplier1-4 for Supplier associations.\n  R3DM Type System in Wandora   We have defined six SBPs in total, these are grouped under the Symmetric Binary Predicates group. Five of them have been configured with special symbols to be used in Wandora\u0026rsquo;s Topic tree. Each one of them is expanded on Wandora\u0026rsquo;s graph panel to show the pair of its association members. The Holonomy-Meronomy Predicate has been used to connect association members to association type.\nWandora class has also five group members, we have already seen four of them. The fifth one is a Variable Type group and it has four sub-categories, Categorical Variable Types, Meta Variable Types, Numeric Variable Types and Time Variable Types. Each of these specialized types has instances and each instance can be further specialized. For example, starting from bottom to top :\ngr isInstanceOf Part Unit isHyponymOf Unit isInstanceOf Categorical Variable Type isHyponymOf Variable Type isMemberOf Wandora class\nIn this way all values are single instances of some type and they are hyperlinked to build associations (hyperedges). Each association is also an instance of some type.\nSummary We conclude our discussion of Association in Topic Map data model. Topic map data model is profound and at the same time powerful and simple to start building higher constructs to model real things. Association in Topic Map is a first class citizen. Here is a list of interesting features we discussed in this post :\n  We can define single instance Topics (and/or values) and then associate them.\n  Association is a bidirectional n-ary relation with Type and Roles embedded.\n  Because of 1. and 2. we can traverse the graph from any point to any other point simply by filtering nodes and edges.\n  We can display both Topic/Association types and instances on the same graph\n  Data from multiple data sets cab be merged with R3DM type system that is based on symmetric binary associations.\n  There are other powerful features of Topic Maps related to associations such as merging and information resources that are attached to topics, i.e. occurrences, we reserve time and space to highlight them in a forthcoming article.\nWe will continue our demonstration with the Catalogue-Part-Supplier example. This time we will examine how associations can be represented on the Graph Model of OrientDB DBMS.\nCross-References  LinkedIn Published Posts LinkedIn Semantic Web Research Group LinkedIn Topic Maps Community Data Science Central DZone - Database Section  ","date":1472774400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1472774400,"objectID":"d1510bf6970b8b223e844a3b0fdab877","permalink":"https://healis.eu/en/post/20160902/","publishdate":"2016-09-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/post/20160902/","section":"post","summary":"Part 2/6 of the series Associative Data Modelling Demystified","tags":["Semantic_Web","Topic_map","Sign_(semiotics)","Triangle_of_reference","Signified_and_signifier","Associative_model_of_data","Data_model","Semantics","Database","Database_management_system","Graph_database","associative_semiotic_hypergraph","Computational_semiotics","Associative_entity","Ontology_(information_science)","Topic_Maps","Serialization"],"title":"Association in Topic Map Data Model","type":"post"},{"authors":["Athanassios I.

They were based on data models such as Column, Document, Key-Value, Graph and Multi-Model. At about the same time, big corporations in IT industry were concerned with data processing of large and complex data sets. Big data movement was a major driving force to re-examine whether current DBMS were sufficient to cope with the new requirements on data processing. More specifically the four V\u0026rsquo;s of Big Data, i.e. volume, variety, velocity and veracity, put an increasing demand in major companies and organizations. This had as a result a reinvestigation on what DBMS technology to apply. Many started realizing that physical representation of data on the disk or in memory and data modeling are key factors on how you build or integrate parts of your IT solution.\nWhile most players in the IT sector adopted Graph or Document databases and Hadoop based solutions, Hadoop is an enabler of HBase column store, it went almost unnoticed that several new DBMS, AtomicDB previous database engine of X10SYS, and Sentences, based on associative technology appeared on the scene. We have introduced and discussed about the data modelling architecture and the atomic information resource unit (AIR) of AtomicDB. Similar technology has been the engine power of Qlikview, a very popular software in Business Intelligence and Analytics, since 1993. Perhaps it is less known to the reader that the association construct is a first class citizen in Topic Map semantic web standard and it is translated to (RDF), the other semantic web standard. In other posts of this series we can see how it is possible to implement Associative Technology in multi-model graph databases such as OrientDB, in object-relational DBMS such as Intersystems Cache and Oracle or build the engine for in-memory processing with Wolfram Mathematica. In this article, we introduce the concept of association from the perspective of Entity-Relationship (ER) data model and illustrate it with the modelling of a toy dataset.\nSupplier-Part-Catalogue Dataset Our dataset is a collection of three related database tables. Two of the tables, Supplier ( TSV, XLSX ) and Part ( TSV, XLSX ), represent and describe Entity Types, i.e. Relations. The third one, Catalogue ( TSV, XLSX ) is the associative entity, a.k.a. bridge table, junction table, join table, etc. The typical case where data for the bridge table is captured is from a business inventory where each item is recorded with its unit price and a quantity in stock. Such information is stored in our Catalogue table, together with a date the item record was modified and a flag that indicates inspection of the stock.\nThe ER Data Model Quite often (ER) Data Model is confused with the Relational Data Model. The reader should become familiar with the following equivalent terminology.\n   ER Data Model Relational Data Model     Entity Type (Set) Relation (Table, Base relvar)    Heading - ordered set of attributes    Body - set of n-tuples, extension of a predicate   Entity\t(instance, member) Tuple (ordered set of attribute values)       Value Set Type name (data type)   Value Attribute value       Relationship set View (Result set or Derived relvar)   Relationship (association)        Attribute (function) Free variable of a predicate   mapping of Entity Set or Attribute name of the relation (column)   Relationship Set to Value Set ordered pair of attribute name and type name    In this classic paper, \u0026ldquo;The Entity-Relationship Model - Toward a Unified View of Data\u0026rdquo; Peter Chen defines relationship as an association among entities. In the same paper entity and relationship are illustrated as hypergraphs. In particular, Fig. 2 at page 13 and Fig. 3 at page 14 show how an instance from an Entity/Relationship set is linked to either values or other entities. Although Peter Chen did not describe these fundamental constructs of his data model with Hypegraph terms, it can be easily seen in these captured figures that a specific entity or relationship form hyperedges with other entities or values that play the role of hypernodes.\n    (Emploee):Ei at Fig.2 and (PROJECT-WORKER):Ri at Fig.3 form hyperedges       (Emploee):Ei at Fig.2 and (PROJECT-WORKER):Ri at Fig.3 form hyperedges   Association and Associative Array We extend the definition of association in the (ER) data model to cover both Entities and Relationships. In the aforementioned paper, Chen formally defines attribute as a function which maps a given entity to a single value (or a single tuple of values). He also mentions that relationships have their own attributes whose meaning depends on the associated entities. The (key,value) pair of an Associative array, a.k.a. map, symbol table, or dictionary, captures this functional operation of attribute.\nWolfram Language - Association Wolfram Language is using Association fundamental construct to represent an associative array. The following three Wolfram Language associations represent a relationship of a Catalog instance with a Supplier instance and some Part instance from our toy dataset.\n(* Supplier Association *) \u0026lt;|supID-\u0026gt;1081, supName-\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Acme Widget Suppliers\u0026#34;, supAddress-\u0026gt;\u0026#34;1 Grub St., Potemkin Village, IL 61801\u0026#34;, supCity-\u0026gt;\u0026#34;ILLINOIS\u0026#34;, supCountry-\u0026gt;\u0026#34;USA\u0026#34;, supStatus-\u0026gt;10|\u0026gt; (* Part Association *) \u0026lt;|prtID-\u0026gt;998, prtName-\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Fire Hydrant Cap\u0026#34;, prtColor-\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Red\u0026#34;, prtWeight-\u0026gt;7.2, prtUnit-\u0026gt;\u0026#34;gr\u0026#34;|\u0026gt; (* Catalogue Association *) \u0026lt;|supID-\u0026gt;1081, prtID-\u0026gt;998, catPrice-\u0026gt;11.7, catQuantity-\u0026gt;400, catDate-\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Wed 10 Sep 2014\u0026#34;, catCheck-\u0026gt;True|\u0026gt; What we are missing in this representation are the hyperedges, i.e. the nexuses that link together hypernodes. According to hypergraph terminology, the edge that connects a hyperedge to a hypernode is called hyperlink or connector. You may think of these hyperlinks/connectors as hash fields but we need another identifier for the hash key, i.e. an identifier for the instance. We could have used supID, prtID or a combination of these two but we prefer to define new identifiers for hyperedges. The main reason for this is that in principle we want to design a uniform way of addressing and identifying both hyperedge and hypernode instances at a low-dimensional, e.g. (2D,3D,4D), space. If we encode this way, it is possible to avoid namespace problems. In this post we use names to compare the graph with figures from Peter Chen\u0026rsquo;s paper.\nWe may also connect hyperedges, e.g. we can add a \u0026ldquo;type\u0026rdquo; hyperlink that maps instances to classes, a \u0026ldquo;vendor\u0026rdquo; hyperlink that maps a Catalog instance to its Supplier instance and a \u0026ldquo;stockItem\u0026rdquo; hyperlink that connects Catalog instance to Part instance. In Wolfram Language it is relatively easy to make a graph of these Associations. We colorized the graph according to the different data types we have, i.e. hyperedges, strings, doubles, integers, dates, and booleans, Fig.4.\n    Hyperedges are displayed in red, strings are in grey, doubles in lightblue, integers in green, dates in lightgreen and boolean in black   JSON Serialization Another very popular representation for Association is JSON Serialization. Those associations we described above can be serialized with the following format.\n{ \u0026#34;$PartI\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;$Item\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;prtID\u0026#34;: 998, \u0026#34;prtName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Fire Hydrant Cap\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;prtColor\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Red\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;prtWeight\u0026#34;: 7.2, \u0026#34;prtUnit\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;gr\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;$SupplierJ\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;$Organization\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;supID\u0026#34;: 1081, \u0026#34;supName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Acme Widget Suppliers\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;supAddress\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1 Grub St., Potemkin Village, IL 61801\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;supCity\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ILLINOIS\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;supCountry\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;USA\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;supStatus\u0026#34;: 10 }, \u0026#34;$CatalogK\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;$Inventory\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;supID\u0026#34;: 1081, \u0026#34;prtID\u0026#34;: 998, \u0026#34;catPrice\u0026#34;: 11.7, \u0026#34;catQuantity\u0026#34;: 400, \u0026#34;catDate\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2014-09-10\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;catCheck\u0026#34;: true } } Catalogue, Parts and Suppliers tables are also available in JSON format.\nAssociation vs Relation Although the logical view of Chen\u0026rsquo;s (ER) data model and his popular diagrammatic technique incorporates Entities, Relationships, Attributes and Values, at the physical layer of any relational DBMS we find records, i.e. Entities or Relationships are ordered tuples. A set of these ordered tuples that have the same heading, is called body. This header is another ordered tuple with attribute names. Theoretically speaking the body and the header of a table make the Relation. In practise the header is separated from the body and located at the database catalog together with other metadata for the schema of the database. SQL standard specifies a uniform mean to access this catalog.\nWolfram Language - Relation The List fundamental construct of Wolfram Language can be used to represent a Relation. An extensive analysis of various representations and transformations on the constructs of the Relational data model in Wolfram Language can be found here.\n(* Part Relation with a header and three tuples (body) *) { {\u0026#34;pid\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;pname\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;pcolor\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;pweight\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;punit\u0026#34;}, {991, \u0026#34;Left Handed Bacon Stretcher Cover\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Red\u0026#34;, 15.5, \u0026#34;lb\u0026#34;}, {992, \u0026#34;Smoke Shifter End\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Black\u0026#34;, 3.75, \u0026#34;lb\u0026#34;}, {993, \u0026#34;Acme Widget Washer\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Red\u0026#34;, 142.88, \u0026#34;kg\u0026#34;} } The reader will notice that in both Associative array and Relation representations, the cell of a table, i.e. the value of an attribute, is always functionally dependent on the description of Attribute and Entity/Relationship. It cannot stand on its own without these semantic references. Moreover, for the Relation representation, the exact order of values has to be maintained together with any missing (NULL) values.\nData Redundancy Relational databases are usually normalized to eliminate duplication of information and ensure referential integrity. This is especially recommended in one-to-many relationships. Normalization involves arranging attributes in tables, nevertheless in a relational database we cannot escape from data redundancy completely. For example if we take the unit attribute of the normalized Part table above we can see that values are still repeated. Most important the schema of a relational database is too rigid and cannot be easily modified without breaking normalization and compromising referential integrity.\nStructured Query Language (SQL) Performing queries of data in a relational database is highly dependent on these two factors we briefly mentioned above, the physical representation of data on the disk and the normalization procedure. One of the main bottlenecks with SQL is the natural join relational operator, counterpart of logical AND. An SQL Join is a means for constructing a result set combining columns from two (or more) tables by using values common to each. The more tables you join and the bigger the size of each table the more time it takes to consolidate the data of the view. On the contrary in many graph databases, connected nodes, i.e. record instances, are directly linked to each other. Each node, contains a list of pointers of its edges, therefore avoiding look-ups. In fact you are not searching for records, you are traversing connections instead. This may dramatically reduce the speed of constructing the result set of a query.\nFor demonstration and comparison purposes we provide such a JOIN sql query for our toy database together with an ER diagram of the database schema,Fig.5 and the result set on a Microsoft Access table view, Fig.6.\nYou may also download a Microsoft Access, accdb file format, database to experiment with.\n    Image illustrates the ER diagram of database schema       Image illustrates the ER diagram of database schema   SELECT Catalog . catsid , Catalog . catpid , Suppliers . sname , Parts . pname , Catalog . catcost , Catalog . catqnt , Catalog . catdate , Catalog . catchk FROM Suppliers INNER JOIN ( Parts INNER JOIN [Catalog] ON Parts . pid = Catalog . catpid ) ON Suppliers . sid = Catalog . catsid ORDER BY Suppliers . sname DESC , Catalog . catcost DESC ; One can immediately notice the complexity of SQL query language on the nested SQL Join constructs.\nSummary In this article we described several limitations of the ER model that we wish to overcome, in brief these are:\n Functional dependence of values Data redundancy Join operations  In the next article of our series we continue with an international industry standard for information management and interchange, the Topic Maps Data Model (TMDM). Associations in TMDM are similar to tuples but they have types. Each member of an association plays a role that is defined explicitly. In fact this is in full agreement with Chen\u0026rsquo;s Entity-Relationship diagrams (see Fig.1 and Fig.2 above). Chen discusses the role of an entity in a relationship and the role of an attribute in a relation and he considers distinct constrains on allowable values for a value set and constraints on permitted values for a certain attribute.\nTMDM view is edifying because it divides information space in two layers. At the conceptual level we have topics that can be associated and represent any subject that can be conceived by a human being. At the occurrence level we have addressable information resources that describe those subjects.\nCross-References  LinkedIn Published Posts LinkedIn Update Data Science Central DZone - Database Section  ","date":1472083200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1472083200,"objectID":"6ab37fbf4d1d6e6b91aa4105f27325cc","permalink":"https://healis.eu/en/post/20160825/","publishdate":"2016-08-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/post/20160825/","section":"post","summary":"Part 1/6 of the series Associative Data Modelling Demystified","tags":["Semantic_Web","Topic_map","Sign_(semiotics)","Triangle_of_reference","Signified_and_signifier","Associative_model_of_data","Data_model","Semantics","Database","Database_management_system","Graph_database","associative_semiotic_hypergraph","Computational_semiotics","Associative_entity","Entity–relationship_model","Serialization","Relational_model","Association_(object-oriented_programming)","Associative_array","Relational_database"],"title":"Relation, Relationship and Association","type":"post"},{"authors":["Athanassios I.

OrientDB RESTful HTTP API commands are ported into Wolfram Language through URLFetch and then ODBapi commands are built with arguments that specify options with rules of the form name -\u0026gt; value. This package has also other utility functions especially implemented for OrientDB. OrientDB Package is part of the Wolfram API application project. Visit the official page of the project for installation and testing instructions.\nDiscussion OrientDB is a multi-model, NoSQL, DBMS based on 16 years of research. Orient Technologies, the company that supports the product, has published more than 60 releases and there is constant and frequent adaptation to user demand and the latest technology available. OrientDB is Open Source and FREE for any purpose. Good news are that this OrientDB Mathematica Package is also Open Source and Free.\nOrientDB is using an SQL-like programming language for managing data. We consider that this can be a turning point for innovation, adaptation, and extension of SQL language. Although SQL is widely used and familiar to many programmers, we argue that its use becomes complicated on graph data models. OrientDB SQL, i.e. OSQL, has been extended to cover operations on Graph Model, but with the cost of adding extra SQL commands. This level of detail can be hidden from the user, and a more abstracted language can be built to cover both the Graph Model and the underlying Document Model.\nMoreover, normally SQL consists of a Data Definition Language, Data Manipulation Language and Data Control Language. In OrientDB there are 34 different commands divided into six categories. Four of them are related to the manipulation of data structure (Graph,Schema,Index,Database) and two of them concern operations (Create-Read-Update-Delete and Utility).\nThere is some analogy of OSQL with the ODBapi function of the OrientDB Package. We are overloading the function with multiple definitions that are derived from the use of optional and mandatory arguments. This differentation is based on the commands (Add, Del, Get, Update, Import/Export, Login/Logout) and the various data structures (Server, Database, Class-Vertex-Edge, Property, Record, Document, Value). See the documentation page below for more information.\nWe argue that this effort to transform the OrientDB SQL set of commands to a function with parameters is a good start for a uniform, universal treatment of data language (UDL). Most important in such a design are: the parameter for the basic operation (ADD, DEL, GET, UPD, LNK, IRT, LOG), and the parameter for the type of construct e.g. Database, Class, Property, Record, and Value.\nWith that guideline in mind, SELECT becomes GET, INSERT and CREATE become ADD, TRUNCATE AND DELETE become DEL, UPDATE and ALTER become UPD. The current OrientDB package needs more programming effort to reach the state we described. But we foresee that it will be far more intuitive, user-friendly and easy to program than its SQL ancestor.\nConclusion Most of the functionality of OrientDB HTTP-JSON API is embedded in Mathematica. The user is able to work with OrientDB database in the native Wolfram Language environment. Wolfram API application project in general combines fundamental bult-in data structures, List, Rule, Association and Dataset of the Wolfram Language with the native JSON permanent storage, retrieval and manipulation mechanism of OrientDB database. The project is open source and free, therefore it can be downloaded from those interested in building Mathematica application projects and those interested in porting data from RESTful services and NoSQL databases into Mathematica.\nDocumentation Pages For demonstration purposes, we have included here the following documentation pages in pdf format for the ODBapi and ODBgetFieldAttributes functions of the OrientDB Package\nIt seems that your browser cannot display the PDF file; Please use this link  instead.

Hatzis, PhD"],"categories":null,"content":"Information The origin of the word information reveals its use. Inform comes from the Latin verb informare, which literally means to give form, or to form an idea. Form is the mold, the container, that is used to give shape, to molten the content. When computer scientists were designing and constructing the first digital computer, at the same time digital information was given birth and shape. Modern computers operate with memory chips and those are mere containers of storing sequences of 0s and 1s.\nPlērophoria The above interpretation and use of the word information is typical of western culture way of thinking. Although it is convenvient to keep things in boxes, Eastern philosophers used to think differently. The ancient and modern Greek word for information is πληροφορία, which transliterates (plērophoria) from πλήρης (plērēs) “fully” and φέρω (phorein) frequentative of (pherein) to carry through.\n It literally means \u0026ldquo;bears fully\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;conveys fully\u0026rdquo;. In modern Greek the word Πληροφορία is still in daily use and has the same meaning as the word information in English 1\n This contrasting use and interpretation of the word plerophoria traces its roots back to Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle’s theory of semiosis. In this regard every word plays the role of a symbol, i.e. sign that can be interpreted to communicate information to the one decoding that specific type of sign. There is an intimate and inseperable connection of the signified, i.e. the concept whose meaning the interpretant attempts to decode, with the signifier, i.e. sign’s physical form such as the sound of a word.\nEvery bit of digital information, i.e. 0 or 1 assimilates this triadic relationship. Bits are symbols signified as true or false taking the form of input voltage (signifier). The infinite combination of sequences of such symbols gives us the power to represent anything digitally. Their meaning depends on how we interpret these sequences, as numbers, letters, sounds, color, or anything else that can be encoded. The form of the signifier is not limited to that of a mere container that stores a sequence of 0s and 1s. It is a fully functional level of abstraction connected to higher and lower levels by applying recursively the theory of semiosis until we reach CPU’s binary level.\nThe Turing Machine One-tape Turing machine according to Hopcroft and Ullman can be formally defined as a 7-tuple. Elements of this tuple are members of three distinct sets. A non-empty set of tape alphabet symbols, e.g. {0, 1}, a non-empty set of states, e.g. {A, B, C, HALT} and a set of state transitions e.g. {L, R}. Turing machine reads the tape symbols and executes a sequence of instructions according to a state table. Although this is not the space and time to adapt the theory of semiosis on the Turing machine we can clearly see an analogy. The tape symbol plays the role of a sign, the signified instruction is executed according to the interpretation given by the state table, and there is the physical form it takes as a printed text symbol on a white square of a paper tape. You can apply the same logic to the set of states and the set of transitions because these are symbols (signs) too; they can be interpreted and realized in some other physical or non-physical form.\nR3DM/S3DM Abstraction Mechanism In digital representation of information we can define a chain of interpretations, representations and realizations that are built in a consecutive order. This chain of semiosis reveals the mechanism that we can use to build higher levels of abstraction. At each step the symbol that is used to link together the signifier with the signified can become a fundamental unit, i.e. signifier to build the next level of abstraction. Thus we can move in two directions, we can generalize or we can specialize.\nCross-References  LinkedIn - 20140613 Computational Semiotics - Information vs Plerophoria LinkedIn - 20150523 Article - Plerophoria vs Information    Wikipedia, the Etymology section of the term Information was updated by user Healis with the quoted text above on the 13th of June 2014 \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1432339200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1432339200,"objectID":"a7364af80cb6663a5748513a9140c1cb","permalink":"https://healis.eu/en/post/20150523/","publishdate":"2015-05-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/post/20150523/","section":"post","summary":"The ancient Greek origin of the word information","tags":["Data_model","Abstraction_(software_engineering)","Information"],"title":"Plerophoria vs Information","type":"post"},{"authors":["Athanassios I. Hatzis, PhD"],"categories":["Semantic_Web"],"content":"Table of Contents  The Variable-Value Pair (VVP) VVP and the identity crisis on the web Conceptual Model vs Data Model Data and Metadata A Computational Semiotics Explanation  Realization Representation Reference Resource     The Variable-Value Pair (VVP) Recently, 5th of November 2013, another serialization of RDF, JSON-LD was proposed by W3C. This made me think over about the fundamental data representation in computing systems and applications. It is the name–value pair, key–value pair, field–value pair or attribute–value pair according to Wikipedia.\nProfessional IT developers will recognise it also as the variable-value pair in programming, as the (Object, Attribute), Value pair in OOP, as the field-value in RDB databases, as the key-value in no-SQL databases, as the query string in URL, as the (SP)-O in RDF and as the attribute-value pair in the most popular data interchange format in our days the JSON open standard format. This demonstrates how powerful this \u0026ldquo;pair\u0026rdquo; is. Two fundamental observations arise from this comparison.\nFirst, there is an emergent need to describe any kind of relation between two things in a natural, human readable way. And second, there is the power of using it as the cornerstone to build on top of it. Everything has to be expressed as VVP in a semantic layered approach, similar to what the Topic Map data model proposed, i.e. distinguish between associations between concepts and occurrences for the representation of them. In my opinion, this is where the semantic web stack fails as it has mixed the syntax, with retrieval of information and representation of it.\nWhat I propose in R3DM data model is a clear separation of Information Realization (IREA), i.e. literals, data types, I call them DataIR or DIR (Data Information Resources) from Information Representation (IREP), i.e. image, web page, quantity, number, etc. I call them BinIR or BIR (Binary Information Representation).\nCollectively I call all of them Information Resources (IRES), or Term Information Resources, TermIR or TIR for simplicity. This definition includes concepts from our daily life like humans, cars, trees and sky.\nIn order to avoid confusion on the definition of all these terms and for identification purposes, Information Reference (IREF), i.e. authority, user, host, domain, etc. has to be added as an extra dimension on the representation of information. I also call this term RefIR or RIR (Reference Information Representation).\nAs a reminder, one can easily arrive in the following memorable formula:\nIRES = IREF + IREP + IREA  Information Resource = Information Reference + Information Representation + Information Realization\nOr expressed in terms of things\nTermIR = RefIR + BinIR + DataIR  And in an even simpler form as\nTIR = RIR + BIR + DIR  In fact, the U1R3DM, Unified Information Resources with Reference, Representation, Realization Data Model proposes a new information theory that is based on the hypothesis that any information resource can be computed and represented as the unity of three components that happen to occur naturally in the description of Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s semiotic triangle. This is exactly what is illustrated in this post.\nVVP and the identity crisis on the web The more I am re-searching the subject of data modeling the more I understand the confusion that arises from the use of the variable-value pair, I am calling it VVP for short. Many of you will recognize that this is the fundamental unit of construction in computer hardware/software architecture including databases, i.e. Storage and retrieval mechanism. Nevertheless many fail to grasp the semantics behind this simple assignment statement of the VVP, i.e. VAR = VAL. Pointer logic in computer programming is very helpful here. Or think about a post box (container) with a street address and an envelope (content) inside. It\u0026rsquo;s also important to think about the type of container (post box) and the type of content (envelope).\nWhat is the analogy with R3DM an identifier to (R)epresent the variable name, a.k.a container a literal to (R)ealize (materialize) the value, a.k.a content a memory address to (R)eference / De-Reference its content\nRepresentation + Realization + Reference  You can see Variable from three perspectives, as an identifier, as an address and as a container with a type (data type). In the current semantic web of linked-data URI is overloaded with many roles, i.e. dereferencing, identification, serialization (Relational, Topic, Graph, JSON-XML). Is there a way to combine all these different perspectives in R3DM ? I think perhaps there is one.\nConceptual Model vs Data Model RDF triplet, (Subject, Predicate, Object) or (Entity, Attribute, Value), strictly speaking, is neither a conceptual (information) model, nor a data model.\nBy definition conceptual model, is about concepts. It is about how I can deliver some message, I have in my head to someone else. Normally we use natural language, words, sentences, speech as the vehicle to convey that message. But that is not the only medium we use, think about art, figures, pictures, photos, diagrams, tactile feedback, music, video, and many others that are not based on words, that are not based on natural language.\nSo, let us assume for a moment that we focus on only textual representations. Is that SPO adequate as a constructing unit to model observations, data sets, or relations ? If yes, is there a standard way to structure concepts and relate instances ? Think about the components of SPO. Predicative units can become attributive and the opposite, object can take the position of a subject and the other way around, relations can be inverted.\nBut perhaps the most annoying of all is the abuse of that conceptual model to use it at the same time as a data model. That means to link values, such as numbers, strings and dates and binary objects. And of course everybody raises his hands when you ask the question, what exactly that value or that object represents. Or how about thinking the classic coding distinction in passing arguments. Are you calling by value or by reference ? Do you embed objects, are you building complex data types, how do you model the multi-value properties ? If you think there is a standard way to answer all these questions, think again because there is not one.\nSo, here comes R3DM into the game to make things more clear, Reference, Representation and Realization. Think about realization the encoding of 0s and 1s you have stored in memory. This is the only \u0026ldquo;real thing\u0026rdquo; you have stored. That is the lowest level of representation that computer understands. Then we have another level of representation, the highest one that we are familiar with, the conceptual level, it is about terms that we naturally think, that we naturally construct in our brains. And the third level of representation is an intermediate one. It is connecting the two worlds, the human one with the computer one. That is a vehicle, a medium we use to convey the message, the information according to semiotic triangle. We can use text, images, sound, video, etc to achieve this as long as we can digitize media.\nResource = Reference + Representation + Realization  the three levels of representation are unified as one and one is seen in three. That is the beauty of R3DM.\nData and Metadata One of the main obstacles in data modeling is that we try to understand the mechanism of abstraction. In fact we are trying to model abstraction, to model the machine that creates models ! Recall at this point what is metadata. It is data about data. So you see how easily you can fall into a loophole.\nThink about the \u0026ldquo;name\u0026rdquo; term. It is one of the most essential concepts we use to model, to reason, to refer, to identify. It is so hard to escape from naming and change everything to an alphanumeric id. Who is doing the naming, what does he mean, in what natural language ?\nName is just one of the many \u0026ldquo;signs\u0026rdquo; we use according to \u0026ldquo;semiosis\u0026rdquo; to carry the message, a piece of information. Think about any kind of programming paradigm, or any kind of data model or information model. You draw a flowchart, a nice diagram, to describe your model and at the same time you use symbols and words-terms to enhance it. All these are different kind of signs we use. So, do we have a model of the signs and how we use them to construct information and store, retrieve and update our data ? Not, at the moment I think.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s move now to a term that apparently has become so popular in NoSQL movement, schemaless databases. That does not mean, there is not a schema. It means the database you use allows you to construct any kind of schema dynamically. In a sense we are talking about a database that has a generic kind of schema that enables you to produce any kind of schema.\nAre you getting the picture now, data-metadata, schemaless-schema, data model - abstract model. It is an abstract machine, think about Turing machines, finite state machines, recursive functions, and lambda calculus and you get closer to it.\nA Computational Semiotics Explanation Resource = Reference + Representation + Realization  Realization The following Wikipedia pages are related to realization, you may open and read about:\n Data type : en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type Data structure : en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure Class : en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming) Object : en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science)  You read the content of the web page with a specific presentation format suitable for the user and with at least three levels of encoding at the back for machine processing purposes.\n wiki encoding : Wiki data type (interpretation of bits) html encoding : HTML data type (interpretation of bits) machine code : Series of bits  To keep things simple, encoding is about the format you give for various purposes, for data storage, for human reading, for human listening, for execution of machine instructions, and many more. If you started thinking about file types, and serialization formats like RDF and JSON I must say you are on the right path. We are at the data level where everything is centred around the encoding of the content. If we apply recursion to reach the machine encoding level, we have to think about a base case. For example, you can encode an integer as a 16bit binary number or 32bit binary number.\nRepresentation How do we represent an integer. In programming we call it an identifier, the name of a variable. This is our entry level to the world of semantics. According to semiotics, it is about signs we use to represent information about an entity. To continue our example, if we want to encode and use a salary figure we can write:\nSalary = $150000\nThe left part (and the dollar sign) is the (R)epresentation (container) and the right part is the value (content). It is the (R)ealization of a monetary value. Such identifiers in computer programming are many, property names, class names, method names, and relations.\nReference Speaking about computer programming, the following Wikipedia pages are related to reference:\n Pointer : en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming) Reference : en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_(computer_science) Key : en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_key Identifier : en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identifier  The concept of reference must not be confused with other values (keys or identifiers). In the previous example\n \u0026ldquo;Salary\u0026rdquo; is an identifier, a (R)epresentation of an integer value \u0026ldquo;Salary\u0026rdquo; is a reference, a (R)epresentation of the memory address where we encode the integer value.  To avoid that confusion, programmers defined another term, the pointer. Pointer (R)epresents a memory address. We dereference pointer to read the value, we use pointer to access memory block and store the value. The same idea is behind the dereferencing mechanism of WWW and the URL. But the URL reference has been overloaded:\n URL denotes the source of information, e.g. Wikipedia. URL is used to disambiguate terms, e.g. Object in object-oriented_programming. URL is used to fetch the html content of the web page  Resource The way we view information resources in our model is mainly through the use of terms (Term Information Resource - TermIR). If you take any of the previous web addresses, you have the term, the realization of the term (DatumIR), the representation of the term (SignIR) and a reference (RefIR) to the content. These are three concepts in one, and one concept in three.\nTIR = RIR + SIR + DIR  ","date":1383609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1383609600,"objectID":"213138b3ec862b26fb2896d6b57063a8","permalink":"https://healis.eu/en/post/20131105/","publishdate":"2013-11-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/post/20131105/","section":"post","summary":"Discussion on the variable-value pair and the identity crisis on the web","tags":["Semantic_Web","Topic_map","Sign_(semiotics)","Triangle_of_reference","Signified_and_signifier"],"title":"S3DM/R3DM vs RDF","type":"post"},{"authors":["Athanassios I.

Think about resources as nodes in a graph, each resource is represented with a node. There are nodes that represent digital assets or concepts that exist in the digital world (computer/web) such as files and web documents, and there are nodes that represent things on our world such as persons, objects, and abstract entities.\nRepresentations and Realizations are referenced differently. For example, take the \u0026ldquo;Programming Language\u0026rdquo; concept. You may use the \u0026ldquo;Wikipedia\u0026rdquo; reference work, see (REF), to check for a definition or do the same with the \u0026ldquo;Free Dictionary Vocabulary\u0026rdquo;. In general you may have multiple references for the same entity. On the other hand once you reach at the realization stage, you have access of the value of the specific representation. In that case the URL address of the web/computer resource (aka realization) serves as the primary mechanism to retrieve or update that value. It is exactly the same analogy with the use of variables in computer programming to access the content of a memory storage and manipulate the value there.\nExamples in TMDM  Instance of PERSON type with observations   The table shows that for an instance of type PERSON (TIR), we may have several observations of properties of type AGE and HEIGHT. For each one of these observations we can have one or more realizations.\nExample 1 Athanassios (p1) is 44 years old and his first name in Greek is Αθανάσιος\nOccurrences with scope\n {p1, AGE, \u0026ldquo;44\u0026rdquo;} /YEAR /INTEGER /PRESENT /NUMERIC /LITERAL {p1, AGE, \u0026ldquo;Athanassios is 44 years old\u0026rdquo;} /STRING /PRESENT /TEXT /ENGLISH /LITERAL {p1, AGE, \u0026ldquo;== Athanassios is 44 years old\u0026rdquo;} /STRING /PRESENT /WIKI /ENGLISH /LITERAL  Occurrences without scope\n hasProp(p1:PERSON, a1:AGE)  {a1, VAL, \u0026ldquo;44\u0026rdquo;} {a1, DTYPE,\u0026ldquo;INTEGER\u0026rdquo;} {a1, UNIT, \u0026ldquo;YEAR\u0026rdquo;} {a1, TIME, \u0026ldquo;PRESENT\u0026rdquo;}    Associations ONLY\n  hasProp (p1:AGENT, a1:AGE)\n hasReal (a1:AGE, INT:DTYPE, val03:VAL, NOW:TIME, YR:UNIT) hasReal (a1:AGE, STR:DTYPE, val04:VAL, NOW:TIME, HTML:ENC, EN:LANG)    hasProp (p1:AGENT, n1:FNAM)\n hasReal (n1:FNAM, STR:DTYPE, val09:VAL, TXT:ENC, GR:LANG) hasReal (n1:FNAM, STR:DTYPE, val00:VAL, TXT:ENC, EN:LANG)     Visualization of Example 1 in Wandora application using ONLY associations   Example 2 Athanassios (p2) was 1 m high at the age of four\nOccurrences with scope\n {p1, AGE, \u0026ldquo;4\u0026rdquo;} /YEAR /INTEGER /PAST /NUMERIC /LITERAL {p1, HEIGHT, \u0026ldquo;1\u0026rdquo;} /m /INTEGER /NUMERIC /LITERAL  Associations ONLY\n hasProp (p1:AGENT, a2:AGE, h1:HEIGHT)  hasReal (a2:AGE, INT:DTYPE, val07:VAL, PAST:TIME, YR:UNIT) hasReal (a2:AGE, TXT:DTYPE, val08:VAL, PAST:TIME, STR:ENC, EN:LANG) hasReal (h1:HEIGHT, INT:DTYPE, val05:VAL, cm:UNIT) hasReal (h1:HEIGHT, TXT:DTYPE, val06:VAL, STR:ENC, EN:LANG)     Visualization of Example 2 in Wandora application using ONLY associations   Example 3 Athanassios (p1) and Aki (p2) are now taller than 1m\nAssociations ONLY\n hasProp(p1:AGENT, h2:HEIGHT) hasProp(p2:AGENT, h2:HEIGHT)  hasReal (h2:HEIGHT, INT:DTYPE, val01:VAL, NOW:TIME, cm:UNIT) hasReal (h2:HEIGHT, STR:DTYPE, val02:VAL, NOW:TIME, TXT:ENC, EN:LANG)     Visualization of Example 3 in Wandora application using ONLY associations   Comparison of R3DM with TMDM Granularity TMDM: \u0026ldquo;Everything is a Topic\u0026rdquo; R3DM: \u0026ldquo;Everything is a Resource\u0026rdquo;\nAbstraction levels and units There are three abstraction levels united in one\nResource = Reference + Representation + Realization and respectively define basic information resource (IR) units at each level\nTerm IR (TIR) = Reference IR (RIR) + Signal IR (SIR) + Datum IR (DIR) In TMDM you have Topic and Topic characteristics where Topic name, Topic Occurrence, Topic Role = Signal Information Resource (SIR)\nAddress (Referencing) In TMDM there are addressable and non-addressable subjects. This IS THE point of major confusion in many models. In R3DM addressing is dependent on the abstraction level.\nIn DIR the content of the datum is accessed by reference, ONLY. You MUST know the subscript of the multidimensional array. In R3DM everything is stored in a multidimensional array and there are projections in every other kind of data structure including Tables in RDBMS, Documents and Graph in NoSQL.\nIn RIR addressing means referencing in a broader sense and that includes modelling of many concepts here, context, scope (see TDMD), and provenance.\nIn SIR it is about construction of Signs (e.g. identifiers, names, labels, etc\u0026hellip;.)\nRelationships (R3DM) - Associations (TMDM) There is another hot topic that of Relations-Relationships again the same tactics are followed like addressing. It depends on the abstraction level we are discussing\nFor example in TIR we have relationships among Terms and in DIR we are discussing about data structures.\nWhat I consider fundamental in both models is that everything has to be based on a common unit of information processing, i.e. Topic in TMDM vs UniformIR in R3DM. Another absolutely critical similarity is the explicit definition of an abstraction level that models concepts, i.e. subjects according to TMDM or TermIR according to R3DM. Another distant similarity can be traced at the Sign level, S2 of R3DM compared to the level of occurrences in TMDM. Needless to say that in R3DM all types of identifiers are treated equally at S2.\nCross-References  LinkedIn - 20130724 Topic Maps Community LinkedIn - If we were to redesign Topic Maps - Topic Maps Community Comments Wandora - Forum Post LinkedIn - 20130920 Topic Maps Community LinkedIn - 20140417 Topic Maps Community - First brief comparison of R3DM and TMDM LinkedIn - 20140617 Topic Maps Community - R3DM Formalization v2 quick comparison with TMDM  ","date":1380672000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1380672000,"objectID":"ba01d4d2f678f31e362f5c8e213b41a4","permalink":"https://healis.eu/en/post/20131002/","publishdate":"2013-10-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/post/20131002/","section":"post","summary":"Examples of R3DM illustrated with Topic Map Data Models","tags":["Semantic_Web","Topic_map","Sign_(semiotics)","Triangle_of_reference","Signified_and_signifier"],"title":"S3DM/R3DM in TMDM","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1380585600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1380585600,"objectID":"f41e3fc3284a52c539f116757a1ff657","permalink":"https://healis.eu/en/s3dm/","publishdate":"2013-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/s3dm/","section":"","summary":"R3DM (Resource-Representation-Realization) or S3DM (Signified-Sign-Signifier) is a conceptual model of an information processing system based on semiosis.","tags":null,"title":"R3DM/S3DM","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":["Athanassios I.

It is founded on the concept of Sign from Ancient to Modern Semiotics. S3DM/R3DM framework is based on the powerful theory of the semiotic triangle, a.k.a triangle of reference. We use numerical vectors (signs), to encode abstract things in our mind (signified) to which the sign refers, e.g. Person, name, Car, model. We associate these with data containers-forms that the sign takes for the storage of data values (signifier), i.e. primitive data types (see wikipedia Signified and Signifier article). This trilateral principle of S3DM/R3DM framework permits a uniform treatment of semantics, syntax and storage of information based on a symbolic representation. Next we define a fundamental, atomic information resource unit, (AIR). Those units, in turn, can be easily shaped to form any tabular, hierarchical, or graph data structure in a unified way. Data granularity can be also deeply connected and related to the definition of a fundamental unit of processing.\nComputational Semiotic Triangle        First illustration with porsche Second illustration with  information resources information representation information realization   Third illustration with  concepts code computer storage   Illustration with real-world object (green leaves) Illustration with an event (traffic lights)  The Core Terms of S3DM/R3DM There are two sets of base terms one starting with the letter \u0026lsquo;R\u0026rsquo; and the other with the letter \u0026lsquo;S\u0026rsquo; that we can use in order to convey the fundamental principles of R3DM. Both of the sets are outlined hierarchically into three levels. Each level is described with one or more characteristic words that are useful for memorizing and recapitulating the distinguishing features of R3DM.\nSTerms   S3 : Signified, Sense, Semantic - Signify\n Signified, in Greek \u0026ldquo;σημαινόμενον\u0026rdquo;, to mean something    S2 : Sign, Symbol, Syntax, Structure - SymbolizeS2 : Sign, Symbol, Syntax, Structure - Symbolize\n Sign, in Greek \u0026ldquo;σημείο\u0026rdquo;    S1 : Signifier, Storage (String) - Store\n Signifier, in Greek \u0026ldquo;σημαίνον\u0026rdquo;    RTerms   R3 : Information Resource - InfoRes (Enity) - Originate\n  R2 : Information Representation - InfoRes (Symbol) - Represented\n  R1 : Information Realization (Datum) - Realized\n  Other Terms There are also other terms that are often used when we describe relations, operations and features in R3DM these are:\n Referenced Interpreted Formatted Expressed Decoded Encoded Parsed  Trilateral Relations The trilateral schema of relations between R1, R2 and R3 or equally between S1, S2, S3 defines the core mechanism of semiosis. We will use the terms we defined in previous section to build simple sentences that convey the full meaning. We will also use three prepositions \u0026ldquo;from\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;through\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;in\u0026rdquo; that accompany RTerms and STerms in a specific order that signifies the left to right direction of abstraction\n  Direction from S1 through S2 in S3\n Data from S1 are Symbolized through S2 and Signified in S3 Data from S1 are Decoded through S2 and Interpreted in S3 Realization from S1 is Parsed through S2 and Interpreted in S3    Direction from S3 through S2 in S1\n Information Resources from S3 are Represented through S2 and Realized in S1 Information Resources from S3 are Represented through S2 and Encoded in S1 Information Resources from S3 are Represented through S2 and Formatted in S1    An Interpretation from S3 is Symbolized through S2 and Formatted in S1    Information Resources from S3 are Symbolized through S2 and Stored in S1    S3DM/R3DM Dogma With the term dogma we want to bring together a set of R3DM principles laid down by an authority as incontrovertibly true. R3DM dogma serves as part of the primary basis of R3DM modelling system, and it cannot be changed or discarded without affecting the very system\u0026rsquo;s paradigm. R3DM is serving one purpose to become the paradigm of paradigms, the metamodel of metamodels.\nS3DM/R3DM Formalization v2.0   S3DM/R3DM is a conceptual model of an information processing system based on semiosis. S3DM/R3DM fundamental construct is the uniform information RESOURCE (UIR), i.e. a parent class of the following three derived subclasses :\n  A Term Information Resource (TIR) models any concept, subject, topic, idea at a highest level, S3, i.e. sense, context level, of abstraction. TIR is also called the signified information resource\n  On the next, intermediate level, S2 - sign level, a Sign Information Resource (SIR), models the notion of the sign in semiotics. Therefore (TIR) is REPRESENTED by (SIR).\n  Finally at level, S1, i.e. data level, (SIR) conveys information that are encoded inside a data container, i.e. Datum Information Resource (DIR), signifier. The content inside (DIR), i.e. data, is expressed with an atomic or complex data structure and REALIZED with operations on data. Therefore (SIR) is REALIZED by (DIR).\n  In all the levels, S3, S2, S1 of abstraction references are created and maintained for the context of the signified concept (S3), the construction of signs (S2), and for the addressing of containers and the indexing of content that express signifiers (S1). Thus, information resources are REFERENCED differently depending on the level of abstraction by a Reference Information Resource (RIR).\n  There is also a hidden level S0, machine-system level, where everything is encoded and expressed with a sequence of binary digits but this currently out of our scope.\n Memorizing the formula In a concise way S3DM/R3DM can be described in any of the following memorable ways\n  S3DM/R3DM Edges - Duality of Sign\n Any Sign at level S2 is correlated to a Signifier at level S1 and the Signified at level S3    S3DM/R3DM Nodes - Triadic Relationship\n Any information RESOURCE at level S3 can be REPRESENTED at level S2 and REALIZED at level S1 using a different REFERENCE mechanism at each level.    S3DM/R3DM Nodes - Triadic Relationship\n Information RESOURCES are REPRESENTED, REALIZED and REFERENCED    S3DM/R3DM Nodes - Triadic Relationship\n Information RESOURCES are originated FROM level S3, are represented THROUGH level S2 and encoded IN level S1    S3DM/R3DM Formalization v1.0 In fact it occurs that this formalization is also the first attempt to formalize the notion of the word “plerophoria”, i.e. information translated in Greek, using Aristotle’s semiotic triangle of meaning.\nS3DM/R3DM models any concept C at a highest level, L2, of abstraction.\nInformation RESOURCES about that concept are REPRESENTED and consequently encoded using a combination of signs S at an intermediate level, L1, into a message M.\nThen at the lowest level, L0, the content of M is expressed with a complex data structure D and REALIZED with operations on data containers.\nIn all L0, L1, L2 levels of abstraction, we maintain REFERENCES for the context (L2), for the construction of signs (L1), and for the addressing of containers and the indexing of content (L0).\nThe Trilateral Principle Resource, symbol and data, each plays a distinct role but they are united with a trilateral relationship and act as one thing. They are present at every level of R3DM as\n  Signified - Sign - Signifier   or  Resource - Representation - Realization    In fact you cannot separate these three things in any computer engineering architecture, the signifier (the concept, semantics), the symbol (serialization, syntax), and the signified (storage, data form, i.e. strings, numbers, bits). They stay together from the lowest level of abstraction, to the highest level. You can only link these meaning triangles side by side and move in two directions, specialization or generalization, Sowa Ontology, Metadata, and Semiotics.\nSymbol\u0026rsquo;s Duality Principle EVERYTHING is represented with a symbol  There is a duality on the characteristics of a sign. Symbols play two roles at the same time that of a container and content. These roles cannot be separated, they always come in pairs. You may think in terms of how computer memory works to understand this. In digital computers EVERYTHING is represented with a sequence of bits, but this sequence is stored in an array of memory cells. Therefore any such fundamental construct, i.e. data structure, that can be build at a higher level should comply with a symmetrical design, i.e. Types, Instances, Values, and Relations-Associations all of them have to be constructed from these atomic fundamental constructs.\nThe Threefold Tower of Babel in Information Technology A concise synopsis of the chaotic situation that is present in information technology is this:\nThe user is experiencing a threefold Tower of Babel\n in semantic web and linked data - conceptual modelling, in computer programming - symbolic modelling in persistent or temporary storage and retrieval of information - data modelling.

It means to carry, to convey a message thoroughly, exhaustivelly, in a complete way. It is strongly related to the formation of the message, it depends on the sign vehicle we use to transmit the message.\nWhat is an information resource It is a container of information. In the computer world a data container such as a blog, a web address, physical memory, computer hard disk. In the physical world any object can be an information resource.\nWhat kind of information resources we have A binary information resource (BIR) is a container of information about concepts related to the computer world, such as a web page, a file, an email, a database record, a programming variable. A term information resource (TIR) is a more generalized concept than BIR. TIR is extended to cover any term in general including those we use in our daily human to human communication. Both BIR and TIR represent abstract concepts. These are constructs that we use at the semantic, ontological layer of R3DM.\nWhat is an information reference An information reference is the source of information resource. It is where it gets its meaning, it is the place it was originally conceived or defined. Any BIR or TIR is conceived in the human mind in the process of thinking. Therefore it follows naturally that they are referenced accordingly. Human concepts are presented from the sender in a verbal, oral, visual, or written way and are perceived from the receiver. Regarding to the meaning, the semantics of the transmitted information, there is strong connection between the interpretant and the sign vehicle used to carry information. The sign vehicle is strongly dependent on the information reference, i.e. the interpretant. We can have more than one interpretations for the same sign, and likewise any sign is referenced in many ways.\nWhat is information representation Let us take things from the beginning. We have a concept in a human mind. The concept is presented in some perceivable way with symbols, icons, words, spoken sounds, etc. This represents an object of the real world that we want to talk about. In a computer we use metaphores: for example the desktop environment with files and folders on it. In fact any object of the real world can be represented in many ways on a computer screen: characters, numbers, images, sounds, books.\nWhat is information realization Everything that is represented in a computer is in fact encoded in a binary format. Any content, such as text for example, can take many forms but at the end it is stored or transmitted in a binary format. In computers, this is the lowest level of information, it is the data level.\nWhy semantic models like RDF/OWL and TMDM are not sufficient for the semantic web First let me make something clear. Semantic web is not the web of linked data, it is simply an approximation. In Web 1.0 and 2.0 we were linking documents, e.g. web documents, files. What is different now, is that we also link structured data, from relational databases, from RDF databases. But we are still in the data level. In my opinion Web 3.0 has to be differentiated from the current web, it has to create a distinct layer on top of the existing linked data layer with its own referencing scheme that can be resolved with the current URI scheme. This will have its own way to define and handle terms, concepts, relations, axioms, rules, the structural components of an ontology. The semantic web, is an ontological web. Everything else should revolve around it, data population, ontology enrichment, subject indexing, searching, matching, sharing.\nWe can not make a significant progress on the \u0026ldquo;semantic web\u0026rdquo;, because there is not a model that combines the three main models of information architecture:\n The database model (data level - Information Realization), The programming model (symbol level - Information Representation) and The semantic model (human level - Information Referencing).  Indeed, there is ongoing research on RDF data model towards a semantic object framework, to bridge the gap between RDF and object-oriented programming and there are also researchers that investigate the mismatch of RDF with graph models and graph databases, especially property graph databases. R3DM is looking into combining those two interpretations of RDF by utilizing a post-relational database and a native object script language.\nIs there an analogy of your model with the object-oriented programming paradigm where you have reusable and composable structures I think the first question that has to be answered, is how we define the fundamental unit of information processing. Remember, in Topic-Maps Data Model everything is a topic. In our writing system, word-lexeme-morpheme, is our fundamental unit. The current progress with graph databases, and the long research with RDF triplets indicate, that indeed, we can define such a unit. Let us call this information node (iNode). The new question you should ask is how exactly these nodes are related. How do we represent relations ? The encoding of information into triplets has started long time ago, both with the Entity-Attribute-Value databases and now with the linked data movement. Although OWL is supposed to bridge the gap between programming and semantic relations, in practise this has never been achieved! A new programming language that will be based on a transparent handling of semantic relations and the corresponding data management is absent. This new programming language must be closely connected to the database layer.\nSemantic web or the web of linked data is using URIs to identify and to address information resources, is there a difference in your model We are trying to develop a new, semantic web, layer on top of the previous one, where the document, i.e. web page, file, etc is the basic unit of information. The two layers can communicate with the current web addressing infrastructure but the new layer MUST have its own referencing scheme. A scheme that will be used both for retrieving and updating purposes. The naming/identification issue is also of critical importance here.\nWhat is the outmost objective with your R3DM data model The current www is based on content (data) and addressing (hypelinks) and the main founder and visioner of the Web Tim Berner\u0026rsquo;s Lee cries out \u0026ldquo;put the data on the web\u0026rdquo;. But the point is how to represent and link the human knowledge on the web, things like concept maps (Novak), conceptual graphs (Sowa) and these are based on linking concepts, not data. I would like to see the web of linked concepts. I see an obsession in many for machine readable data. The point is how our technology can assist us in making fast and smart decisions, in solving extremely complicate problems of interdisciplinary nature and machine readable data is just part of it.\nDomain Independent Abstraction and Kinds of Relations I think it is fundamental for the improvement of this kind of “Semantic Web”, LinkedData Web, if there is going to be some effort to describe and represent abstraction and relation types. We would not have to deal with such a chaos of alignment and mapping on predicates if there was some generally acceptable template, formula on what kind of Domain Independent Abstractions exist and how we can formulate them.\nPart of my R3DM data model and the work in it, is to define such a schema. I will give you a flavour here with an example that is characteristic of the confusion that exists between two specific generic relation types, (1) inheritance-subtyping and (2) hypernymy-hyponymy. Consider the following:\n  (1)\tMusic composition \u0026mdash;- isBroaderThan \u0026mdash;\u0026gt; Sonata\n  (1)\tSonata \u0026mdash;- isNarrowerThan \u0026mdash;\u0026gt; Music Composition\n  (2)\tMusic Instrument \u0026mdash;- isHypernymOf \u0026mdash;\u0026gt; Wind Instrument\n  (2)\tWind Instrument \u0026mdash;- isHyponymOf \u0026mdash;\u0026gt; Music Instrument\n  Notice that both relations are symmetric and we need to define both directions. Each entity plays also a specific role in that relation. Now, if we can find a consistent way to describe relations that will make life much easier for both the developers and the researchers in “Semantic Web” area.\nIn my opinion, we can define three broad classes of hierarchical relations that create all kinds of taxonomies (read more about them in other recent posts in this group).\n  Generalization-Specialization expressed with the predicates nulon:isBroaderThan and nulon:isNarrowerThan and the roles Superior, Subordinate\n  Hyponymy-Hypernymy expressed with the predicates nulon:isHypernymOf and nulon:isHyponymOf and the roles Hypernym, Hyponym\n  Holonymy-Meronymy expressed with the predicates nulon:isWholeOf and nulon:isPartOf and the roles Whole, Part\n  Triples can be seen as binary predicates, but n-ary relations is a very natural way of thinking about many things such as events. This is exactly the point of a big divergence among TopicMapDM, RelationalDM, GraphPropertyDM, Freebase DM, Associative DM, RDF/OWL DM and others.\nI think modelling n-ary relations is not the root of the problem. The mother of all problems in data modelling is the bootstrap mechanism of creating types and the absence of a single universal Upper Level Ontology as the gold standard to define core basic types. Take Freebase for example, they have defined from scratch their own type system.\nThis again cannot be seen in isolation of the data structures, a low level issue, that one is using to permanently store or process the data. This is why I insist that software engineers have to think in at least three perspectives of R3DM semiotic data model, i.e. the semantic, the symbolic and the storage.\nCross-References  LinkedIn - 20130403 Greek IT Network LinkedIn - 20130920 Topic Maps Community LinkedIn - 20130927 Semantic Web Research LinkedIn - 20131129 Computational Semiotics LinkedIn - 20131227 Semantic Web Research - Domain Independent Abstraction and Kinds of Relations LinkedIn - 20131229 Semantic Web Research - Taxonomy Relations - My perspective LinkedIn - 20131129 Computational Semiotics - About Binary and N-ary relations  ","date":1380585600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1380585600,"objectID":"032851fd6764d1ac2b7def60b58cc05a","permalink":"https://healis.eu/en/post/20131001/","publishdate":"2013-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/post/20131001/","section":"post","summary":"Old wiki pages on R3DM ported from neurorganon.org","tags":["Semantic_Web","Topic_map","Sign_(semiotics)","Triangle_of_reference","Signified_and_signifier","Information"],"title":"S3DM/R3DM Q\u0026A","type":"post"},{"authors":["Athanassios I.

We identify this set as information resources 1\n Assume we accept this definition for \u0026ldquo;information resources\u0026rdquo;. Let us take a real apple. Then we ask ourselves, is that apple an information resource according to the previous definition. In my opinion, the answer is No. Because we cannot convey all the essential characteristics of an apple in a message, even if the message is transmitted through conventional human to human communication channels. If someone has not tasted an apple before then you cannot convey that characteristic in a message. One has to eat the apple to learn about that characteristic and many more.\nIn addition to that, many will be familiar with pictures like the following one from artist Rene Magritte showing a pipe and underneath a text message in French saying \u0026ldquo;this is not a pipe\u0026rdquo;.\nWell this is not a pipe indeed, it is an information resource about a pipe. To be more specific this is a visual representation (image encoding) of a pipe. Or you may also say we present graphically, we draw a pipe. It is something that refers to a real pipe, but it is not the pipe. In fact, no matter what is the volume of information you are going to use about a real pipe, you will never manage to convey the true or full meaning of what a pipe is. But enen in the case we approach a very detailed description of something, then the main obstacle is the interpretant and the interpretation of the message.\nIn a more recent effort of W3C to distinguish between digital information resources and real-world object it uses URIs to identify both of them.\n On the Semantic Web, URIs identify not just Web documents, but also real-world objects like people and cars, and even abstract ideas and non-existing things like a mythical unicorn. We call these real-world objects or things 2\n This is part of a bigger problem due to the inherited weak logic, theory and definitions that support RDF data model. The reader can search for many of these discussions that have appeared on the web under the search term \u0026ldquo;web identity crisis\u0026rdquo;. I believe the root of the problem lies on the inadequate meaning of word information as it is expressed in English. Linguists are aware of the distinction between signifier and signified and Greek language is serving well that purpose as the word \u0026ldquo;plērophoria\u0026rdquo; (signifier) conveys better the meaning of the word \u0026ldquo;information\u0026rdquo; (signified).\n The ancient Greek word for information is πληροφορία, which transliterates (plērophoria) from πλήρης (plērēs) \u0026ldquo;fully\u0026rdquo; and φέρω (phorein) frequentative of (pherein) to carry through. It literally means \u0026ldquo;bears fully\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;conveys fully\u0026rdquo;. In modern Greek the word Πληροφορία is still in daily use and has the same meaning as the word information in English. In addition to its primary meaning, the word Πληροφορία as a symbol has deep roots in Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s semiotic triangle. In this regard it can be interpreted to communicate information to the one decoding that specific type of sign. 3\n Origins of a new theoretical framework on information representation We propose a new theoretical framework that will cover RDF/OWL and Topic Map data models, the EAV model in RDBMS and the object-attribute-value model in OOP. So far there have been very weak attempts to bridge the gap among the Semantic Web, the Relational Databases world, the Object-Oriented programming community and recently the NoSQL Databases arena. All these need a solid theoretical framework that unifies them and an implementation that exhibits that these technologies are simply different perspectives of the same approach to information representation.\nCross-References  LinkedIn - 20130403 Greek IT Network LinkedIn - 20130403 Topic Maps Community  LinkedIn - 20130403 Semantic Technologies  LinkedIn - 20130403 Semantic Web Research LinkedIn - 20130403 Database Experts LinkedIn - 20140613 Computational Semiotics - Information vs Plerophoria LinkedIn - 20150523 Article - Plerophoria vs Information    Architecture of the WWW, W3C Recommendation 15/12/2004, section 2.2 URI/Resource Relationships \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Cool URIs for the Semantic Web, W3C Interest Group Note 3/12/2008, section 3 URIs for Real-World Objects \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Wikipedia, the Etymology section of the term Information was updated by user Healis with the quoted text above on the 13th of June 2014 \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1364947200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1364947200,"objectID":"9e7b99991b6125d7dbca008b219b66be","permalink":"https://healis.eu/en/post/20130403/","publishdate":"2013-04-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/post/20130403/","section":"post","summary":"The problem of defining, representing and identifying an information resource","tags":["Semantic_Web","Topic_map","Sign_(semiotics)","Triangle_of_reference","Signified_and_signifier","Information"],"title":"Origins of a new theoretical framework on information representation","type":"post"},{"authors":["Athanassios I. Hatzis, PhD"],"categories":["Semantic_Web"],"content":"Visit Demo Site Introduction Neurorganon Upper Level Ontology (NULON) is a top-level ontology also known as a foundation ontology. It includes a list of very general terms grouped in ontological distinct categories , such as address , agent, artifact, device, document, space, time and many others. These categories determine the most fundamental and the broadest classes of information resources. In NULON members of each class, i.e. vocabulary terms, preserve the same meaning across more specific knowledge domains and other reference work. In that aspect it is similar to a thesaurus because it groups together terms in disjoint collections of mostly similar concepts and it is like a dictionary because it can also include multiple, multi-lingual definitions. It is also an ontology because it defines relations and properties that describe how the terms can be linked together or bind them to web, computerized information resources. NULON recent version, numbers more than 500 core vocabulary terms grouped in 47 maximally disjoint categories. All these terms have been consistently mapped to standard definitions from at least two major reference works in the realm of semantically linked data; OpenCyc and Wikipedia. Respectively their information resources are used as identifiers and references for NULON terms. Most important, at this stage of architectural design what makes NULON really different from other Upper-Level Ontologies is the kind of grouping of the terms and the categories included and described in the οntology. This is the result of a big effort, the whole year, from a single person, to discover and organize efficiently most terms related to information technology, including abstraction, management, computer programming, data storage, metadata, data modeling, identity, reference, design patterns, web use, digital resources and devices to name a few of them.\nFrom NEURON to NULON  A computer is a general purpose, programmable electronic device, for storing and processing data. From the era of personal computers to the age of mobile devices, we are storing data into files and web pages. We are processing electronic documents with myriads of formats. We organize our file collections into hierarchies with folders. We use them to share information. So far the digital document is the main vehicle of information exchange and at the same time the obstacle for effective management of information and interconnection of information systems. Information technology industry is still waiting for the promised revolution in terms of web software and services.\nThis partly happened with Web 2.0, the social collaborative user environment that made the need to escape from the document centric computing more urgent. The published content has to be independent of the container so that it can be viewed in many alternative ways and combined easily in many forms. In all these years of computing evolution, there is very little that has been achieved to bridge the gap that exists between the presentation of information to the user and the storage of information on the computer.\nBut what if we could unify and standardize the processing of information from the lowest level of storing data up to the highest level of consuming the data as interconnected pipeline services. Then the flow of information, the interoperability of services and the communication among users can be achieved by defining a new kind of data abstraction that will enhance and gradually replace the electronic document. This is the information resource/reference (IR) a term that is so confused and obscure in Semantic Web technologies.\nYou can now start drawing the analogy from computer networks to neural networks. IR is the fundamental unit of processing similar to “neuron”, and the Neurorganon project has already implemented IR in NULON (Neurorganon Upper Level Ontology), a solid theoretical framework that is the foundation for linking concepts together and attaching binary information resources (BIRs). With NULON we can model any kind of data as a graph with nodes (IRs) and edges (associations) and store permanently the network of information in state of the art database management systems that are also based in graphs, the perfect marriage for data modeling.\nMost important, with NULON it is now possible to reuse, redesign, repurpose, recombine and interconnect existing software tools for extraction, integration, transformation and visualization of information. Tools will be commercialized, or offered for free, as services and will be used to connect NULON to Web Browser Applications and Graph databases. Eventually we foresee the empowerment of a user with a decentralized network of services that will place him or his community group in charge of a personalized, specialized knowledge graph that will be tailored to his needs.\nFinally, with respect to organized information, new browsing methods will appear on the web. These will be present in the form of linked autonomous networks of concepts that will be either automatically created or semi-automatically designed by the expert user again with the help of software as a service. There has to be control for the level of detail and the depth of information, as well as a highly interactive environment to experiment with the visualization of data and the various templates that will assist in the dissemination of information from and to the user.\nArguably the most challenging aspect on this kind of megaproject is to make the user to feel in a natural and comfortable way as it is most often the case when he is browsing the internet or when he sends an email to a friend. One has to experience the new environment and the services in relation to other internet users and tasks that he/she is already accustomed to accomplishing.\nThe team behind the Neurorganon/NULO project will be aligned with that scope in mind, and the experience and skills of the members involved will eventually guarantee a mature and viable technology and methodology that will lead the development of new generation products and services in the information technology industry.\n","date":1354579200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1354579200,"objectID":"8554b6353dae011fe41b35cc996f37c6","permalink":"https://healis.eu/en/project/nulon/","publishdate":"2012-12-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/project/nulon/","section":"project","summary":"Neurorganon Upper Level Ontology is an attempt to define the core ontology of Web 3.0 in a practical, well defined, standardized and consistent way.","tags":["Upper_ontology","Semantic_Web","Topic_map","Formal_ontology","Namespace","Abstraction_(software_engineering)","Type_system"],"title":"NULON","type":"project"},{"authors":["Athanassios I. Hatzis, PhD"],"categories":["Semantic_Web"],"content":"Table of Contents  Introduction About Ignite Talk  Rehearsal Live performance Presentation     Introduction In computers, information is always encoded in binary data format and it is processed accordingly. But the presentation of information to humans is dependent on the use of it. This becomes most evident when we compare a computer programmer to the end-user of an application or the web. A programmer can read and understand code in many programming languages, he can process the content of a file in many different formats. He uses various forms of symbol representation to manage information and interact with the machine. Indeed, in the history of computer science there are numerous examples of handlers that play such a role, e.g. file and folder referring to data stored permanently, URL addresses referring to web resources, primary and foreign keys referring to tables of data, names for classes of objects and their instances referring to the encapsulated data and methods.\nIn all cases the common ground for representation of information, the vehicle of information communication, appears to be some symbol, a\u0026quot;sign\u0026rdquo; according to Peirce theory, that represents the actual thing itself. Fortunately that \u0026ldquo;sign\u0026rdquo; has already been modelled in a standard way that of Topic Maps ISO/IEC 13250. Nevertheless what has not been realised so far in computer systems is the concept, i.e. topic, centric use of applications. Within this perspective there is a clear distinction between an existing digitised information resource, e.g. web document, and the abstract notion of a concept, e.g. wikipedia, where the first is linked to the second. Instead of that, proponents of semantic web contemplate linking everything as a resource. As a result we are still revolving around web documents with metadata that describe them. We can escape from this fallacy. Imagine a global network of linked topics and a tour guide from WWW to GGG, from the world of linked documents to the world of linked concepts and subjects. You journey has just begun.\nAbout Ignite Ignite is a fast-paced geek event started by Brady Forrest, Technology Evangelist for O’Reilly Media, and Bre Pettis of marketbomb.com, formerly of MAKE Magazine. Ignite is a global event, organized by volunteers, where participants are given five minutes to speak about their ideas and personal or professional passions, accompanied by 20 slides. Each slide is displayed for 15 seconds, and slides are automatically advanced. The following presentation is my talk as a pitcher, at the first Ignite event in Athens, Greece.\n  Talk Rehearsal This is a rehearsal of the talk I gave at Ignite Athens.

From the era of great maritime explorers to the era of brain and genome mapping, cartography has continually changed in order to meet the demands of map users. Nevertheless semantic and concept mapping of data on two or three dimensions has several challenging problems to attack. Naming and complexity of objects on the map, representation of relations, layout and presentation, navigation and editing, are among a few to consider. Despite the difficulties that arise on the visualisation part of information architecture, the central issue lies elsewhere. We argue, that the cornerstone for building the next generation of information systems, including the internet, is a well defined and standardised unit that will be human readable for measurement and exchange of information. The equivalent notion of an information unit for machines is indeed one of the most impressive characteristics of our digital information age and it is based on the power of abstraction we apply to a series of two digits only, 0 and 1, in order to conceptualize visually and aurally human information processing. Files and documents, databases and programming languages, web applications and services, email and digital media, enhance the way we communicate with others. Our perceptibility for the world around us is strengthened.","tags":["Upper_ontology","Semantic_Web","Topic_map","Formal_ontology"],"title":"From WWW, the Uncharted World Wide Web, To GGG, the Charted Giant Global Graph","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Athanassios I.

Nevertheless a database often constitutes part of the software. Therefore there is some overlap between the two. The following questions and answers demonstrate a real life scenario that is based on MEDILIG project.\nQ\u0026amp;A Session Why do you apply two licenses ODbL and GPL for the MEDILIG project ? MEDILIG project is a software product/service and it also includes a database. The use of the databasecannot be covered with a GPL license.\nSoftware is normally covered by software licenses. Why did not you apply only GPL license ? GPL does not tell you anything about who controls the database and what are the rights of the user on the database. For example consider the deployment scenario where the software is open but the database is locked. Does the user have the right to unlock the database, does he have the right to export or import his data from/to the database and in what extent? Can he create a derivative database or use the existing one collectively as part of other system developed? Software developers and/or vendors often use databases as leverage to lock users into support contracts and licenses. ODbL grant rights to the user and prevents this behaviour. It is section 3.0 and 4.0 of the full license text .\nWhat parts of the database you cover with OdBL ? Section 2.2a of ODbL license says that it is likely to cover database model or schema. This is true, you may cover the general design, but you cannot cover specific details of the database schema, e.g. Microsoft SQL Server implementation. You can do that only by GPL because it is coding. Another useful distinction between ODbL and GNU GPL.\nWhat about the contents of the database ? There is the content of look-up tables which is usually static, it hardly ever changes, and the content of main tables where you expect to find all sort of information that is added dynamically or exists, such as factual data, images, etc. In my opinion there should be a distinction of the two because look-up data is part of the design and/or customisation of the database. On the contrary content data that the user added on an empty database delivered by the developer have a separate copyright.\n","date":1281398400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1281398400,"objectID":"b15525392a3d451175125c72946099fe","permalink":"https://healis.eu/en/post/20100810/","publishdate":"2010-08-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/post/20100810/","section":"post","summary":"Why do you apply two licenses ODbL and GPL for the MEDILIG project ?","tags":["Medical_software","Health_care","Health_information_management","Health_information_technology","Electronic_health_record","Electronic_medical_record","Software_license","Intellectual_property"],"title":"Open Data vs Open Source Software","type":"post"},{"authors":["Athanassios I. Hatzis, PhD"],"categories":["Health_information_technology"],"content":"Extract from a post to gnusolidario forum of Luis Falcon Recently I released to the public MEDILIG project v1.0 (MEDILIG Source at Sourceforge) under a combination of two licenses GPL and ODbL.\nThe current implementation is based on a combination of Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft Access and there is minimal coding. Therefore a quick conclusion would be that this is a health software under a proprietary operating system. But that limits completely the horizon for this project. Let me throw here a few critical MEDILIG features for discussion.\nI chose to implement the system under Microsoft Technology for two reasons\n Microsoft Technology is still very popular and there are millions of users that use a Windows PC. Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft Access are also extremely popular. It is easy to maintain the server, it is easy to build a complex application in Access in days if not in a few weeks time! Leave aside all the toolkits for Microsoft Access and the great connectivity with other Microsoft Office applications. Since EMR/EHR applications need a lot of tuning and customization to cover the specific needs of the professional, I believe that this combination wins in speed as it concerns Rapid Application Development.  Conclusion: The main financial burden for the user is not the cost to run you application on a proprietary system; this may come free or with a very low cost for the user (e.g. included in the hardware price). It has to do with the the resources spent on building, modifying, updating, maintaining, expanding an application, and it also has to do with connectivity and interoperability issues.\n Now I will attempt to touch the last bit. Technical interoperability in HIT is only part of the problem. There is the semantics problem and the process/workflow dimension. You mentioned MEDICAL running in many different architectures. I consider the main point to be the architecture inside MEDICAL. If MEDICAL is based in a platform independent architecture, then that is the key issue for success. This is the main driving force behind MEDILIG   MEDILIG is using an extensive database schema for continuous health care that follow standard clinical practice terms with an easy nomenclature for developers. This is the main asset of MEDILIG, this is where most of my effort was concentrated on. I will be glad if others start comparing MEDILIG schema with any other open EMR/EHR software schema to realize the differences in the domain architecture. By the way, I started this project because I could hardly see any extensive relational database schema for continuous care. The domain schema in many projects is either too complex to understand, or it is hidden, etc. Why have we abandoned so easily relational databases for an object oriented approach? Aren’t there so many legacy and proprietary systems that are based on RDBMS. How easily migration can be achieved? I am an ambassador of open architecture techniques and not open software or open OS. I want to solve a domain problem as quickly as possible and as cheap as possible. MEDILIG supports complete separation of the database schema from the presentation layer. I strongly support the independent development for the database layer. Has there been any agreement worldwide on a minimal database ER schema for XHR (EHR, EMR, CCR, PHR,….) ? Have they discussed extensively how important is for a health professional to keep his data on a privately own database?  Finally a few lines about the presentation layer, I am skipping the business layer. The modern approach is that there is an integrated environment that provides you the GUI tools to build it and there is some way to connect your form/GUI with the database layer. MEDILIG is using Access only for demonstration purposes, you will see that the code is minimal. I believe that open health IT community of developers/user should head for open services. I have been inspired also from the Infopath Technology, particularly the idea that you can use the form with a set of data independent of the database server. I believe the most successful XHR application would be the one that offers the user the same flexibility as a word processor document or a spreadsheet. Many health professionals are still stuck with pen and paper. Perhaps the easy transition to the e-health era is to use electronic forms and documents on a tablet or on a PDA.

Για αυτόν τον λόγο πιθανότατα κατέγραφε με κάθε λεπτομέρεια τα πεπραγμένα από τις πρωτοποριακές νευροχειρουργικές επεμβάσεις που διενεργούσε για την εποχή του με τα πενιχρά μέσα που διέθετε, μολύβι και χαρτί, δημιουργώντας έτσι την πρώτη «βάση δεδομένων» στον τομέα της νευροχειρουργικής στην Ελλάδα. Σήμερα, επτά δεκαετίες αργότερα, οι έλληνες νευροχειρουργοί του θεραπευτηρίου Ευαγγελισμός έχουν τη δυνατότητα- με τη χείρα βοηθείας της πιο προηγμένης τεχνολογίας- να αντικαθιστούν αυτές τις χειρόγραφες σημειώσεις με ψηφιακά δεδομένα τα οποία δομούν αναλυτικές, ηλεκτρονικές βάσεις που «χαρτογραφούν» τις νευρολογικές παθήσεις στη χώρα μας. Η πολύτιμη αυτή «χαρτογράφηση» είναι μία από τις ποικίλες δραστηριότητες του Ελληνικού Κέντρου Νευροχειρουργικής Ερευνας (ΕΚΝΕ) «Πέτρος Σ. Κόκκαλης», το οποίο εγκαινιάστηκε χθες το βράδυ επισήμως κατά τη διάρκεια ειδικής εκδήλωσης στο Μέγαρο Μουσικής Αθηνών.\nΤο Κέντρο δραστηριοποιείται σε διαφορετικούς τομείς. Ο ένας εξ αυτών αφορά τη δημιουργία και τη λειτουργία προηγμένων βάσεων δεδομένων, όπου καταχωρίζονται αναλυτικά τα στοιχεία των ιατρικών φακέλων των ασθενών που εισάγονται στη Νευροχειρουργική Κλινική του Ευαγγελισμού. Το όλο σύστημα λειτουργεί «on line», όπως εξήγησε στο «Βήμα» ο υπεύθυνος Ιατρικής Πληροφορικής του Κέντρου κ. Αθ. Χατζής. Οσα συμβαίνουν στο χειρουργείο, στους θαλάμους ασθενών ή στις Μονάδες Εντατικής Θεραπείας, αποστέλλονται και εισάγονται κατευθείαν στη βάση με τα στοιχεία του κάθε ασθενούς. Σε πραγματικό χρόνο έχουν όμως τη δυνατότητα και ειδικευόμενοι ή ειδικευμένοι γιατροί να παρακολουθούν από το κτίριο της Πλουτάρχου επεμβάσεις που διενεργούνται από τους ειδικούς της Νευροχειρουργικής Κλινικής του Ευαγγελισμού. Προς γνώσιν και\u0026hellip; συμμόρφωσιν με τις νέες εξελιγμένες τεχνικές και τα δεδομένα.\nΕκτός από αυτή τη γενική βάση δεδομένων υπάρχουν όμως και εξειδικευμένες που αφορούν διαφορετικές παθήσεις και συγκεκριμένα την επιληψία, τη νόσο του Πάρκινσον, τις δυστονίες, τη σπαστικότητα και τον χρόνιο πόνο. Σύμφωνα μάλιστα με τον κ. Σακά, η ειδική βάση για την επιληψία που ονομάζεται ΕΡΙLDΑ- είναι μία από τις πιο εξελιγμένες διεθνώς-, η οποία έχει δημιουργηθεί σε συνεργασία με το Τμήμα Βιοϊατρικής του Εθνικού Μετσόβιου Πολυτεχνείου, φέρνει τους έλληνες ειδικούς στην πρωτοπορία σε ό,τι αφορά μια πάθηση που «πλήττει» χιλιάδες Ελληνες. Η αναλυτική αυτή καταγραφή των νευρολογικών παθήσεων επιτρέπει όχι μόνο την καλύτερη αντιμετώπιση του κάθε ασθενούς με θεραπείες «κομμένες και ραμμένες» στα μέτρα του, αλλά την ίδια στιγμή παρέχει πλούσιο υλικό που μπορεί να διαμορφώσει μια ολοκληρωμένη, για πρώτη φορά, εικόνα σχετικά με τις συγκεκριμένες ασθένειες στη χώρα μας.\nΤο Άρθρο στην Εφημερίδα το ΒΗΜΑ It seems that your browser cannot display the PDF file; Please use this link  instead.

It is the epitome of the research work of Athanassios Hatzis, nine years in total, during his MSc, PhD and two funded research projects STARDUST, NHS-NEAT 275K€ UK project, and OLP12, FP5-Quality of Life 2.67M€ EC project.\n Past Research Projects 1994-2004   Those days Athanassios was a central figure in the department, he has written most of the code for STARDUST and OLP and also acted as the initiator and a group leader of software development for the two funded projects.\nSTAPTK in OLP Background One of the main components of the OLP system is the final release of STAPTK (OPTACIA). OPTACIA was first published in WISP 2001 conference and is strongly based on the software that Athanassios Hatzis developed during his PhD thesis as well as the software developed during the STARDUST project. This final version is linked to the other components of the OLP system by executing OPTACIA through a command-line interface.\nOPTACIA Kinematic Maps An OPTACIA Kinematic map uses a two-dimensional ANN-trained map as a visual metaphor for isolated sounds and simple utterances. We describe the map as \u0026ldquo;kinematic\u0026rdquo; (i.e. relating to movement) because its visualization technique correlates strongly with articulatory movement during speech production. Visualization of speech sounds is instantaneous, the client can vary the articulators in response to on-screen visual feedback. Speech therapy is based on the evaluation of the quality of speech production and accompanied characteristics i.e. consistency and intelligibility. OPTACIA is meant to assist speech therapists in that role.\nPublication Testing a New Method for Training Fricatives using Visual Maps in the Ortho-Logo-Paedia Project (OLP)\nThis paper concentrates on therapy based on real-time audio-visual feedback of client’s speech and presents results from building and testing visual maps for training hearing-impaired clients using the OPTACIA component. OPTACIA was developed from the Optical Logo-Therapy OLT (Hatzis, 1999; Hatzis and Green, 2001). OPTACIA is based on three basic, well-founded treatment principles: visuomotor tracking, visual contrast, and visual reinforcement. Visuomotor tracking (Ziegler, Vogel, Teiwes, and Ahrndt, 1997) is a special case of biofeedback where some dynamic physical measure of performance is portrayed visually in real-time.\nDemonstration   Real-time audio visual animation with a sprite on the map     Real-time audio visual animation and Waveform display on wavesurfer     Visual Feedback Main Characteristics Speech Therapy requirements are translated to visual feedback requirements and therefore the computer-based speech training aid, in our case OPTACIA, has to demonstrate visual consistency (phonetic map areas, and speech trajectories), visual contrast of the target areas of the map, and visual accuracy on the production of speech. In OPTACIA we achieved this with target markers, each target-marker has an area associated around it that is used for scoring purposes. The target markers’ functionality make them very useful because speech therapist can set them to fine-tune OPTACIA map with intermediate targets and establish short-term and long-term speech production targets for patients with various speech disorders.\nOPTACIA Main Tasks  Record speech data Transcribe speech data Build map  select speech data design layout train map   Explore layout of the map Monitor/Measure performance on the map  Future Directions and Problems to solve Researchers interested in the technique developed in OPTACIA should consider the following issues that have been tackled in the present software :\n Acoustic to articulation mapping Synchronizing real-time audio-visual playback and recording Definition and statistical modeling of speech targets Automation of segmentation/labelling problem Automation of training maps The silence/speech detection problem Definition of metrics  Distance from target Acceptance/Rejection Consistency Intelligibility   Visualization of metrics Mapping/Visualisation of unseen speech input Mapping/Visualisation of non-continuous sounds  Technical Specifications STAPTk is based on open-source software but unfortunately University of Sheffield decided not to make it public.\n  Front end GUI in Tcl/Tk and incr-Tcl/incr-Tk\n  Back end speech and graphics processing in C\n  Speech processing with Snack and Wavesurfer (Kåre Sjölander and Jonas Beskow, 2003)\n  Speech detection algorithms, MGR endpointer (Bruce T.

They require the integration of various components of speech technology, such as speech recognition and transcription tools, and a database management system which supports multiple on-the-fly configurations of the speech training application. This paper describes the requirements and development of STAPTk from the point of view of developers, clinicians, and clients in the domain of speech training for severely dysarthric speakers.

With this method speech acoustics are transformed into visual events on a two-dimensional display called a ‘phonetic map’. Phonetic maps are created by training a neural network to associate acoustic input vectors with points in a two-dimensional space. The target points on the map can be chosen by the teacher to reflect the relationship between articulatory gestures and acoustics. OLT thus helps the client to become aware of, and to correct, errors in articulation. Phonetic maps can be tailored to different training problems, and to the needs of individual clients. We formulate the theoretical principles and practical requirements for OLT and we describe the design and implementation of a software application, OLTk. We report on the successful application of OLT in two areas: speech therapy and second language learning.\n PhD Thesis In Acrobat pdf format  OLT Therapy Sesssion   Presentations  1996 Insitute of Acoustics (IOA) Poster 1999 Phonetics Teaching \u0026amp; Learning Conference (PTLC) Poster 2001 Workshop on Innovation in Speech Processing (WISP) Poster    OLTk Introduction OLTk provides on-line, real time audio and visual feedback of articulation by performing acoustic signal analysis. It indicates how closely a speaker’s attempt approximates to the normal or target production of specific speech. The clinician can adjust settings to provide visual and/or auditory reinforcement of the client’s attempts to correctly produce the target.

The price of that laptop was 3000€ and my parents paid the invoice.   OLTk Interface OLTk graphical user interface is split into three parts : the menu bar, the graphics canvas, and the status bar.\nThe phone classes and the sounds represented in the following map are:\n i (violet) as in the word see u (yellow) as in the word shoe o (red) as in the word bought sh (blue) as in the word shore s (green) as in the word suit z (white) as in the word zoo   OLTK GUI   Each map created consists of a number of 9D vectors. Each vector is the output of the cepstral analysis on a 10msec frame of speech. Each frame of speech is labeled according to the phone it represents. We can group phones according to the characteristic sound they represent on the basis of different place and manner of articulation. The different classes of phones can form two dimensional clusters of points depending on the method of mapping. The idea of this 2D sound mapping is to associate groups of similar sounds to neighboring areas on the map. Thus a map consists of a number of clusters and those in turn consist of a number of frames of speech each one associated with a phone label. These two groupings, the clusters and the phones, we call elements of the map and the map itself we call a phonetic map.\nThe above map has been created from 18 children, 9 male and 9 female, age 5-7, all English native speakers recording isolated sounds. The map has a total of 14400 samples and contains six different classes of phones, 3 vowels and 3 fricatives.\nSettings The behavior and the control of the various components of OLT and everything that is an integral part of that program depends upon the \u0026ldquo;Settings\u0026rdquo; pull down menu. All of them are in the form of radio buttons style. By pressing any of these buttons with the mouse the user can either activate or deactivate a certain feature or display or hide other essential components and control windows of OLT. The settings appear in the pull down menu as follows:\n Show Cluster Labels Recording/Playback Types Recording/Playback Parameters Select Samples Animation Types Activate Extracted Buffer Mapping Techniques Map Appearence  Recording/Playback Parameters This radio button can show or hide the recording/playback parameters window. The modification of these parameters is achieved through a set of sliding bars. These include:\n  Duration: The total duration of recording in secs. The radio button existing next to the label of the parameter has to be activated in order to apply a time limit. If the radio button is not checked then you can record for unlimited time.\n  Context: The context width or the number of frames ahead and behind a certain frame. One frame is equal to 10msec. This is used in conjuction with the Playback Frames Sequence tool to define the limits of the part of the utterance to be extracted.\n  Averaging: Average the 2D positions every N number of frames. Set a relatively high value when trying isolated sounds and a relatively low value when trying small utterances. The higher the value the less the flickering and the smoother the animation of sprites.\n  Threshold: Value to determine whether to accept or reject a certain frame of speech. The higher it is, the more similar a new sound should be with those that make up the phonetic map in order to be accepted. On the contrary, if we lower the threshold slide bar the less strict we become on the acceptance of a sound. The higher is the value the more it rejects the less it accepts, the lower is the value the more it accepts the less it rejects. This parameter is used in conjuction with the \u0026ldquo;-Threshold\u0026rdquo; field of the cluster information to tune the threshold of the specific phone cluster according to our needs.\n  Parameters like \u0026ldquo;Averaging\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Threshold\u0026rdquo; have been designed to work interactively with the \u0026ldquo;Real Time\u0026rdquo; recording and playback.\nAnimation Types These radio buttons define the various types of animation that are used to represent the appropriate visual feedback:\n  Animate Sprite: This is the default setting for the animation type. A plane sprite is flying to positions that are related with specific sounds. If the sound produced is quite dissimilar of those existing on our phonetic map the plane disappears from the screen and the frowning of a clown’s face is used to indicate the rejection. In case of acceptance the plane is flying and the clown appears with a happy face. Silence state is also represented with a different plane image that shows it sleeping.\n  Draw Points: If we activate that type of animation we can see the exact 2D positions for each frame of speech or for the average during our speech production. The hits are represented with black filled rectrangles.\n  Draw Trajectory: This is the third type of animation we can select. A visual feedback representation of the sound can be obtained by plotting with filled rectangles and connecting with a line the 2D positions of successive speech frames. As new sounds are produced the old positions are deleted and the new positions are appended. This gives the impression of a moving snake.\n  Mapping Techniques These are the techniques we developed for the mapping of the sounds from 9D to 2D:\n  ND TO 2D: A neural network (NN) has been trained to map all the frames of a particular sound to a certain fixed 2D position on our phonetic map. Similar sounds with those that our NN has been trained with are mapped to neighbooring positions.\n  Central Force: The classification results of a speech frame for each one of the phone classes together with the 2D distances from the fixed centroids of each phone cluster are used to determine the 2D position of the speech frame on the map.\n   Athanassios at SPANDH lab with colleagues   ","date":944006400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":944006400,"objectID":"c29314a46a23c2e2be3dcc828cd434bd","permalink":"https://healis.eu/en/project/oltk/","publishdate":"1999-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/project/oltk/","section":"project","summary":"PhD project, real-time, computer-based, audio-visual feedback training method for articulation","tags":["audio-visual feedback","Articulatory_phonetics","Speech_technology","clinical applications","Assistive_technology","Augmentative_and_alternative_communication"],"title":"OLT","type":"project"},{"authors":["Athanassios I.

This is the first working prototype that is based on R3DM/S3DM conceptual, computational semiotics framework, the theoretical framework behind our technology.\nIntroduction It is remarkable how we turned an electronic device that is processing only 1s and 0s to an inseparable intelligent companion and trustworthy assistant. There is a long historical record of technological achievements in the development of computable information and the interactive engagement of the user. In every step of our technological progress we made systems with better performance, pushing towards a simpler, extensible, modifiable, scalable and generic logic. And the key behind this imaginative use of computers is the captivating abstract thinking process of the human brain. R3DM/S3DM conceptual and logical framework is an attempt to model databases with the very same intimate mechanism that creates models. In this endeavor, there could not be a better theory as the base of R3DM/S3DM other than Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s Semiosis. Semiotics is the study of meaning-making and it binds semantics with symbolic representation and transformation which is the bread and butter of computer programs and digital storage. R3DM/S3DM is not only conceived along this theory, it is also founded on those semiotic principles.\nR3DM Definition  R3DM - Representation(Resource, Realization) or S3DM - Sign(Signified, Signifier) is a computational semiotic framework with a mathematical morphism that formalizes the architectural design of associative hypergraph databases.1\n Following this definition we will unfold R3DM/S3DM and explain its main characteristics starting with the classic three layered database architecture.\nArchitecture Overview One of the main purposes of Zachman\u0026rsquo;s conceptual, logical, and physical database design, is to provide data independence at the application-user level. The three layers are in descending levels of abstraction where the conceptual model is the most abstract and the physical data model the least abstract or most concrete.\nThe conceptual model usually refers to the domain of discourse and describes the semantics of the application without any reference to the database technology. On the contrary, the logical data model implements the concept model in terms of abstract data types, (e.g. List, Set, Map, Graph). In the following list you can see the correspondence between these two layers for five popular data models.\n  Conceptual Schema\n Predicates, Entities and Relationships, Topics, Associations and Occurences, Subjects, Objects and Predicates, Classes and Properties    Logical Structure\n n-ary Relation, Tuples and Attributes, Table, Rows and Columns, Hyperedges, Hypernodes, Nodes, Edges and Properties Objects    Both conceptual and logical layers should act independently of the underlying database engine, i.e. physical data model. The following is an indicative list of what is normally included in this layer.\n Physical Data Storage Organization  Data orientation (rows/columns, correlational), Data structure, Object storage, Block storage, Data cluster, Database index, Serialization    Conceptual Perspective Regarding to the conceptual data model R3DM/S3DM is using terms that are well-known among database experts, i.e. Entities and Attributes. In Code.1 segment we can view instances of Supplier, Part and Catalog Entities and the Attributes that describe them. Remember that in R3DM/S3DM Entities and Attributes play the role of abstract concepts that we associate to create models of our data, they are NOT containers or instances of data.\n  Entity is something that has a discrete, independent existence,\n e.g. Eiffel Tower (Building), Apple Inc (Company), Porsche 993 GT2 with a specific VIN (Car)    Attribute is a piece of information that describes an Entity\n e.g. (referring to the above Entities) 300m (Height), US$215.639 (Revenue), WP0ZZZ99ZTS392124 (VIN)    Association represents:\n An N-ary relation of an Entity with its Attributes (see Code.1)   e.g. Part{ID, Description, Color, Weight} e.g. Part998 {998, \u0026ldquo;Fire Hydrant Cap\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Red\u0026rdquo;, 7.2}  An N-ary relationship between one or more Entities, sharing one or more common Attributes, that is defined by the roles they play in the association (see Code.1)   e.g. Film {StarringActor1, StarringActor2, Director} e.g. FilmID { ActorID1, ActorID2, DirectorID }    Code.1 - Result sets from SQL queries on Supplier, Part and Catalog tables. The same result sets are drawn in Fig.1 with a hypergraph and in Code.2 segment they are assimilated with AIR units in Associations\nLogical Perspective Changing now our perspective with a focus on the logical building blocks, R3DM/S3DM can be viewed as a hypergraph, Fig.1, comprised of three data structures hyperatoms (hypernodes), hyperbonds (hyperedges), and hyperlinks (edges).\n  A hyperbond represents graphically a complex data structure (e.g. tuple, JSON object). The role of hyperbond is to connect a set of hyperatoms in order to form associations\n  A hyperatom represents graphically an atomic data item (e.g. record value, a key-value pair of a JSON object).\n  A hyperlink graphically speaking is a Graph Edge that connects bidirectionally a hyperatom to hyperbond\n    SPC Hypergraph  A hypergraph of Supplier Part Catalog for Part No. 998 with its four Catalog entries and its four Suppliers. Hyperedges are in green and hyperatoms are in red   Instances Perspective Entity or Attribute in R3DM/S3DM are Types and represent uniquely a single Set of Instances also known as items (see also Items Type System). Entities or Attributes can be thought as references to Collections, Fig.2.\n  Domain Abstractions and Specializations  Fig. 2 - Meta Level and Domain Level, i.e. Domain Abstractions and Specializations are abstract types, e.g. a Person, a Credit Card, an Item and refer to the Instance Level. The Instance Level includes domain particular instances, e.g. Tom the person, his Credit Card with No: XXXX, an Item ZZZZ that he purchased     A Collection (set of instances) is a generic container for items with no duplicates. A Collection can have one or more representative concepts (Entities or Attributes). We have two types of collection, Datum Collection and Nexus Collection.\n  A Datum Item (datum) can be thought as an instance of a particular Attribute type that points to a single atomic piece of data (atomic value). A Datum Collection contains Datum Items (data). In our hypergraph perspective Datum Items are represented with hyperatoms.\n  A Nexus Item (nexus) can be thought as an instance of a particular Entity type with a role of associating, binding together, Datum Items. A Nexus Collection is a type of collection which holds Nexus items (nexuses). The graphic equivalent of Nexus Items is the hyperbond.\n  Ponder for a moment here, it is a common ground to consider a type, i.e. class, as a container of its instances. But that is not the case in R3DM/S3DM where abstract concepts (types) have an independent existence and refer to collections, i.e. the containers of instances.\nThis separation between containers of items (instances) and abstract concepts (types) is extremely important as it decouples the data modeling layer from the data collections that are ingested into the database {: .btn .btn\u0026ndash;info}\nSemantic Perspective Data, e.g. names, codes, quantities, time, location, categorical are meaningless without context. They are separated, isolated bits of information with no related context. Data inherits more meaning when the data are processed within a context. This is exactly the purpose of semantic data modeling, a data modeling technique to define the meaning of data within the context of its interrelationships with other data. Semantic models can be either fact oriented, e.g. RDF triples, or object oriented e.g. Entities and Relationships. The disadvantage of the second is that you have to manage dissimilar 2D structures (tables) that are dependent of a fixed database schema and not connected or related directly. The drawbacks of the first are the labeled edges, the modeling of n-ary relations, the inseparable mixture of plain and typed literal triples that represent values with RDF links that represent resources, the Semantic Web Identity Crisis to name a few. R3DM/S3DM assimilates both fact and object-oriented views by defining an atomic information reference unit which is based on semiotics. Naturally, with this solution we escape from many of the above problems. This is one of the most innovative aspects of this framework.\nObject-Oriented View The most commercially successful semantic model is Entity-Relationship data model. In the first post of this series we discussed the conceptual data model that Chen is using to represent the tuples of relational data model. Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 shows that Chen is using either Entity Set, Attributes and Value Sets or Entity Set(s), Relationship Set(s), Attributes and Value Sets to form an Association. The key point here is that Entity set and Attributes in both cases are separated from the Value sets. Indeed, this is the design principle that is followed in any modern relational DBMS. There is a data dictionary, also known as a metadata repository or metadata registry, that stores among other things names and descriptions of Entity Sets, Relationships and their Attributes that construct a database schema.\nSemantically speaking, the database schema and its metadata describe the meaning of its instances, i.e. Entity relations, Entity relationships and Attribute Value sets. For this purpose, in the current OrientDB implementation of R3DM/S3DM each one of these sets is defined explicitly and is represented with an OrientDB Class. There is another reason we keep separate the actual data values. R3DM/S3DM uses a single instance value-based storage. Each unique value in the raw data is stored only once. With this feature there is some resemblance with the data model of Correlation Database.\nNetwork Graph View While it is helpful to view the higher-level Type System Architecture of R3DM/S3DM through an object-oriented filter, it is important to understand that at a low-level R3DM/S3DM consists of nodes and edges. In particular, the prototype framework we describe in this article is built on top of OrientDB Graph engine with Lightweight Edges and a hypergraph structure, Fig.9.\nIn previous posts of this series we have made a comparison of the Association construct with Relational tuples, Topic Map Association, RDF triplet, Property Graph nodes and edges and Qlik binary coded records. Such semantic models, with the exception of Qlik technology, are fact oriented and semantics are typically expressed by binary or n-ary relations between data elements. In R3DM/S3DM the graph is usually undirected with symmetric and typed binary relations between the hyperbond and the hyperatom.\nThis low-level graph view of the system can be implemented in many ways. For example you can have two constructs, e.g. tables, one for the nodes and another for the edges (see the work of Simon Williams in Sentences database), or you can use a key-value store that saves tuples (Graphd the back store of Freebase) or you can also have a native triple store.\nSemiotic View So far we have seen how we can contextualize data using Association construct. This is the mechanism to assimilate tuples of data. Nevertheless, values in a tuple or literals/resources in a triple are meaningless in isolation. In the first case you need either the head and the type of the relation (table and column names), in the second case you need the label and direction on the edge (Predicate) that connects the Subject and the Object to give meaning in the binary relation. To quote Ron Everett,\n Every table is a silo. Every cell is an atom of data with no awareness of its contexts, or how it fits in to anything beyond its cell. It can be located by external intelligence but on its own it’ s a “dumb” participant in the system - the ultimate disconnected micro - fragment accessible only by knowing the column and the record it exists in.\n and according to him,\n The alternative is to replace the data elements with information at the atomic level of the system. Instead of a data atom in a table, we have an information atom with no table.\n Ron Everett in \u0026ldquo;Introduction to Associative Information Systems - (N) Normal Form\u0026rdquo; {: .small}\nTherefore the trick here is to build Associations, based on a uniform representation of its members and the roles they play, in a similar way to Topic Map Association items. For this purpose we have introduced Atomic Information Resource (AIR) unit in the previous post of this series. Now we will view AIR with more detail and in action. For each AIR unit we maintain a record of information. For simplicity and for demonstration purposes, the AIR unit in the current implementation of R3DM/S3DM is equivalent to OrientDB Record ID (RID).\nFor example the Supplier result set in Code.1 is transformed to an associative set and each cell of Supplier table is represented with an RID (Code.2 - Get Supplier Associative Set). Columns of Part table, e.g. pid (Code.1), and any of its values are also represented with RIDs (Code.2 - Get Datum where Parts.pid=998). The single Part tuple where pid=998, (Code.1) is considered to be an instance of a Entity and has an RID too (Code.2 - Get tuples that this Datum is part of).\nThis way AIR information representation serves two principal functions; information resource identification and location addressing, i.e. dereferencing and retrieval. {: .btn .btn\u0026ndash;success}\nCode.2 - Associative sets are presented with values or in RID (reference key) format. The equivalent result sets are drawn in the hypergraph of Fig.1 and fetched with SQL in (Code.1) segment. The document record in OrientDB with RID #60:7 is an instance of prtID Attribute collection. We can read the Datum value, find which Attribute collection (class) it belongs to, and get its siblings, i.e. other Datum items of the class. In the same Datum record we can see its row context associates, i.e. Nexus Items. These are the five tuples it participates, one Part relation (#52:7) and four Catalog relationships (#53:7, #53:11, #53:12, #53:16).\nView Code Frame {: .btn .btn\u0026ndash;small}\nThere are two steps towards this transformation of tuples. First we create a value type system, i.e. a place where we store atomic values based on their type. And second we apply a uniform representation on everything, i.e. data and metadata. This turns our DBMS to a Reference Database Management System (RDBMS), i.e. redefining this way the acronym of Relational Database Management Systems. Remember that deep down to an atomic level we store single instance values. It is only the reference keys to those values that we manage. This enables a cellular granularity on R3DM/S3DM. Metadata with a high granularity allows for deeper, more detailed, and more structured information and enables greater levels of technical manipulation.\nThis uniform Representation and management of abstract information Resources (Models, Data Sources, Metadata) with AIR units in R3DM is the Realization of the fact that underneath there is a separate storage layer of single instance data values. {: .btn .btn\u0026ndash;info}\nS3DM framework is based on the powerful theory of the semiotic triangle also known as the triangle of meaning or the triangle of reference. We use key references (Signs-Symbols), to represent abstract things (Signified Concepts) in our mind. We encode these into data containers, i.e. forms that the sign takes, for the storage of data values (Signifiers), Fig.3. {: .btn .btn\u0026ndash;success}\n    Fig. 3 - R3DM/S3DM Triangle of Meaning, Semiotic Triangle, Triangle of Reference   This trilateral principle permits a uniform treatment of semantics, syntax, storage and structure of information based on symbolic representation. The very same principle is applied to the architectural design of R3DM/S3DM type system. {: .btn .btn\u0026ndash;info}\nEnvironment Type Systems In the previous section we have seen that R3DM/S3DM can be seen from many perspectives. At a lower level we have a network graph of nodes and edges. In OrientDB graph model these are instances of the \u0026ldquo;V\u0026rdquo; (for Vertex) and \u0026ldquo;E\u0026rdquo; (for Edges) classes. At a higher level, based on those two classes, we build a hierarchically organized namespace in OrientDB paginated local storage (plocal). This is the database Environment, the highest organizational structure, a logical container that it may represent a business environment, a user environment, even a programming environment. Its role is to group related classes into eight type systems. Seven of them manage vertices and one of them is for the different types of edges, Fig.4. The process of initializing and defining the structures in OrientDB database is fully automated by reading the schema of the type system from a JSON file, Fig.5.\n    Fig. 4 (Left)- Information about R3DM/S3DM hierarchical type system stored in DBRegistry subsystem       Fig. 5 (Right) - Schema of R3DM/S3DM hierarchical type system in a JSON format. For simplicity, in the current implementation Items Type System (ITS) is not present. Entity Type System (ETS) and Attribute Type System (ATS) OrientDB classes compose this missing system   Our DBAPI project in Wolfram Language has been extended to cover all R3DM/S3DM functionality. For example, an Environment is added with OR3addEnvironment command, (Code.3), and we retrieve any metadata about it with the OR3getAnything command (Code.4).\nOR3addEnvironment[\u0026#34;F:\\tmp\\R3DM_TypeSystem.json\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;R3DB\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;root\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;123\u0026#34;] Code.3 - We pass the schema file (JSON), the name of the database (R3DB), the username and the password. Metadata for the newly created classes are stored in the DBRegistry subsystem Fig.4.\nCode.4 - Retrieval of Environment System Types with OR3getAnything command. By default it is returning a List of references (RIDs) unless we specify a specific format for the structure e.g. Dataset.\nDatabase Type System (DBS) Classes that start with the letters DB such as DBLog, DBUser, DBOperation, and DBUserRole are used to store the user Environment metadata useful for administrative, security, and monitoring purposes (Code.5).\nCode.5 - Retrieval of Primitive Database Types with OR3getAnything command as a List of references or as as Dataset.\nWe have already seen the DBRegistry subsystem where information about the schema of Environment is stored, Fig.4. Another class DBObject is used for casting multi-type role playing at a node (Object is an instance of a Type).\nModel Type System (MTS) Next we will examine how we can add a new domain model in the system. Usually at this stage the database expert draws the entity-relationship diagram of the model which is a graph of Entities, Attributes and relationships. In Fig.6 we present a similar diagram for our Supplier-Part-Catalog data set and in Fig.9 we have drawn the same diagram in OrientDB Graph Editor. The main difference with ER diagrams is that relationships/relations here have a direct representation on the system with the edges (R3DM/S3DM links) and dictionary metadata are explicitly defined and stored in MTS.\n    Fig. 6 - The schema diagram of SupplierPartCatalog Model (red). Entities (blue boxes) and Attributes (green ovals) are written with their full names (blue) and short names (purple) that take positions outside each shape. Entity boxes inside carry their type (red) and their super-type (blue). While inside each Attribute oval super-type (black) and value type (red) is written. We can also see two types of links. LTS_EA (blue) connects Entities with Attributes and LTS_WP (brown) is linking the model with its Entities.   We have serialized the domain model graph of Fig.6 in the same manner as the schema of the type system and the task of loading and building the model is simplified again with the following single function call (Code.6).\nOR3addDomainModel[\u0026#34;F:\\tmp\\SPCModel.json\u0026#34;] Code.6 - The only parameter required in OR3addDomainModel is the schema definition file of the model. This function call will instruct OrientDB to create classes for all Entities and Attributes of the Model. All the metadata from the schema, Fig.6, will be stored in MTS and will be available for retrieval with OR3getAnything command.\nUsing the powerful OR3getAnything function in the context of DBAPIOrientR3S3 package we can retrieve metadata, Fig.6, for any Model, Entity or Attribute. The result set can be in the form of Wolfram Language Dataset, List, or Graph data structures (Code.7).\nCode.7 - Three examples of the OR3getAnything function where we retrieve OrientDB records for Models, Entities and Attributes respectively. The function call is translated to OrientDB RESTful API command and the JSON response from the DBMS is transformed to Wolfram Language data structures for further processing and visualization. It worths noticing the hypergraph representation which is the equivalent graphical form of Model\u0026rsquo;s schema diagram in Fig.6.\nView Code Frame {: .btn .btn\u0026ndash;small}\nTo maintain compatibility and interoperability with ontologies and other vocabularies for structured data on the Internet such as schema.org we categorize Entities and Attributes of any Model according to OrientDB classes that typically form the hierarchical structure of Entity Type System and Attribute Type System.\nEntity Type System (ETS) Entity Types usually refer to abstract entity types. They are used to create schema templates for popular entity types. Metadata are kept in DB_Registry and as usual they can be retrieved with OR3getAnything command (Code.8).\nCode.8 - Retrieval of Entity Types with OR3getAnything command from DB_Registry. For each Entity Type we can view its type and its super-type as well as the name and shortname that can be accessed.\nAs an example consider the schema diagram of Fig.6 where we have three entity sub types, ORGANIZATION, PRODUCT and DATACATALOGUE where we classify the Supplier, Product and Catalogue entity collections respectively (see Code.7, Get Entities section).\nAttribute Type System (ATS) Similarly, Attribute Types refer to abstract attribute types. Each attribute can participate in one or more Entity Types and that is how schema templates are formed. In our Supplier-Product-Catalogue data model, Fig.6, attributes can be classified as CATEGORICAL (Supplier_status, Part_color, Part_unit, Catalog_check), IDENTITY (Supplier_id, Part_id), NAME (Part_nameEN, Supplier_nameEN, Supplier_city, Supplier_country), QUANTITY (Part_weight, Catalog_price), COUNT (Catalog_total), TIME (Catalog_date) and DESCRIPTION (Supplier_address). The following OR3getAnything command demonstrates how we can draw metadata about this type system (Code.9).\nCode.9 - Retrieval of Attribute Types with OR3getAnything command from DB_Registry. For each Attribute Type we can view its type and its super-type as well as the name and shortname that can be accessed.\nEach of these attribute classes above (see Code.7, Get Attributes section) refers to an attribute collection of data items that has a value type. For example, Supplier_status, Part_id, Catalog_total, Supplier_id are of value type INT (integer) and Part_weight is of value type REA (real).\nItems Type System (ITS) This is the system of items collections, i.e. where Entity and Attribute reference instances are stored (see Instances Perspective). In our demo these are represented with OrientDB classes, Fig.7.\n    Fig. 7 - Two Select SQL queries with OrientDB Studio manager. The first one returns four Entity records and the second one returns four Attribute records. Each Entity and Attribute record is represented with an item from a collection. These items in turn are represented with a reference key which is OrientDB @rid   For simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake we have not constructed ITS separately but we used OrientDB classes instead to populate them with instances of Entity and Attribute types. Nevertheless the idea is the same, segregate the abstract concepts, TYPES, from the domain particular INSTANCES.\nValue Type System (VTS) According to our Semiotic View (Fig.3) key REFERENCES (RIDs) represent RESOURCES from DBS, MTS, ETS, ATS, ITS, LTS, DSS and encoded form of data, i.e. REALIZATION of data values. These values have domains that are based on OrientDB primitive data types, e.g. Integer, Double, DateTime, String and types that are defined in the Value Type System (VTS), Code.10.\nCode.10 - Retrieval of Value Types with OR3getAnything command from DB_Registry. For each Attribute Type we can view its RID, type, super-type, name, shortname and the OrientDB data type that is based on.\nData values are stored together in ordered sets based on Value Types, e.g. all integers in one set (VTS_Integer), identifiers in another (VTS_Encoded), and so on. This optimizes the access and management of values. Each Item Collection is a subset of values, i.e. a subset of a value set, Fig.8.\n  Figure 8:   Fig.8 - A subset of the VTS_Integer value set. This record set is obtained with OrientDB SQL select command. Each one of these records is pointed from a datum item of the Supplier_id collection (see Fig.7) using the OrientDB Link type.\nElements of both Value Sets and Item Collections are unique, i.e. a single instance of each one. In OrientDB this is implemented by setting SB-Tree index with UNIQUE keys in both Value set and Item Collection.\nData Sources Type System (DSS) Yet there is another type system in R3DM/S3DM framework that is reserved for the input of data sets, the Data Sources Type System (DSS). A Data Set is considered to be a number of related collections that usually correspond to the contents of flat files or database tables. During the process of adding a Data Setwe do not store the values but only the structure and properties, Code.11.\nCode.11 - Demonstration of the OR3addDataSet command with three parameters, the name of the new DataSet that will be created, the working path and the filenames of the flat files to inspect. This function call will instruct OrientDB to create a new class to store information about the structure of these flat files. These metadata will be available for retrieval with OR3getAnything command (Code.12).\nCode.12 - Retrieval of a DataSet structure, e.g. name, shortname, type, supertype, path, table names, table types, column names, etc, with OR3getAnything command from DSS system.\nLink Type System (LTS) Last but not least the aforementioned symmetric and typed binary relation is a bidirectional link, i.e. hyperlink, that is used to connect a hyperatom to a hyperbond to form Associations. We have two kinds of hyperlinks, directed and undirected. Directed links are used to form directed associations of a specific type, e.g. Entity-Attribute, Whole-Part, Type-Instance Fig.9. Depending on which direction we traverse the link, outgoing or incoming we have two different labels to assist us in reading and understanding the semantics of the binary relation. In all cases metadata about the Link Type System (LTS) are currently stored in DB_Registry and as usual we can retrieve link types with OR3getAnything command, Code.13.\nCode.13 - Retrieval of Link Types with OR3getAnything command from DB_Registry. For each ASSOCIATION type we can view its supertype, name, short name, and the labels for outgoing or incoming traversal direction.\n  Figure 9:  Fig.9 - Schema diagram of Supplier-Part-Catalog model in OrientDB Graph Editor. Red edges connect Entities to Attributes and green edge connect the Model to Entities. We can also view the type of R3DM/S3DM link in LTS system as a label on the edge   Functional Operations The OrientR3S3 Package extends OrientDB RESTful API package in Mathematica with a powerful functional set of commands that cover all operations in R3DM/S3DM. These operations fall in four categories, get, update, delete, add (GUDA). The main idea here is to define standard named optional arguments for any of these functional categories and then allow their values, default or mandatory, to be given using Wolfram Language transformation rules. We have already started viewing examples of this functional approach to data management with the OR3getAnything command, Code.2, Code.4, Code.5, Code.7, Code.8, Code.9, Code.10, Code.12, Code.13.\nGet Anything By varying the named optional arguments we pass to OR3getAnything public function of the OrientR3S3 Package, Code.14, we can retrieve or search for anything in R3DM/S3DM and we can also ask to return the result in a specified format e.g. Dataset, References, Rules, and Associations.\n(* Search Operations *) OR3getAnything[from-\u0026gt;\u0026#34;25:02\u0026#34;,

integrating all add operation in an OR3addAnything function of OrientR3S3 Package. Instead of this unified function we have defined many others such as:\n  OR3addEnvironment [ envstruct, envname, usrname, usrpwd ] - Code13\n  OR3addDomainModel [ jsonFileName] - Code6\n  OR3addDataSet [ datasetName, dataSetPath, fileNames] - Code11\nThus, we have seen how we can add an Environment Type System, a Domain Model and a Data Source. The last two and those that follow are repetitive actions in data analytics lifecycle, i.e. data sources import, modeling, mapping, ingestion, [filtering and aggregation][].\n  OR3addMapping [columns, attributes, mappingRules] - Code15\nThis is a problem of matching the Columns of a Table or in general fields of a data set with the Attributes of an Entity in a data model. {: .btn .btn\u0026ndash;info}\nWe can have fields from multiple data sources that are mapped in the same model. The following code section Code15 demonstrates how we perform the mapping of the Columns from the three Tables of a data set that we added in Code12.\nCode.15 demonstrates the mapping of data fields onto Attributes in three steps. Step1: retrieve metadata from the Data Set and the Model, Step2: specify the mapping rules, Step3: store the mapping.\nView Code Frame {: .btn .btn\u0026ndash;small}\nMapping is necessary in order to proceed with the data ingestion. This allows seamless integration of data from multiple data sources on the model we design in R3DM/S3DM. The following three add operations are used in populating Entity, Attribute items collections with reference instances and the Value Type System with data values. Records, i.e. tuples, are assimilated by creating associations (Code16).\n  OR3addValue [className, propertyValue, propertyName] - Code16\n  OR3addNexus [className] - Code16\n  OR3addEdge [edgeClass, fromItem, toItem] - Code16\nCode.16 demonstrates the ingestion of three data sources (TSV files). First we read headers and body from each file in memory. Then we get the mapping of Columns from the stored Dataset onto the Attributes of each Entity and finally we add values, collections items and associations.\nView Code Frame {: .btn .btn\u0026ndash;small}\n  Filtering It should have become apparent that R3DM/S3DM operates in a different way than other database models. Instead of a Data definition language, Data manipulation language or a Query language (SQL, SPARQL) the functional, uniform set of commands that we have seen in the previous section due to the consistent structure of its type systems and the AIR units makes it easier to manipulate data and elements of the database.\nOne of the most characteristic features of R3DM/S3DM is the ability to filter data in a seamless standard way instead of accessing data with a query plan which may vary between database models. {: .btn .btn\u0026ndash;info}\nThis filtering operation is similar to QlikView and we will make a contrast with the same data set and example case we used in the 5th article of this series.\nCase1: Condition and Sorting Order In this case we are looking for the Supplier that has the minimum Catalog Price for a Red Fire Hydrant Cap and we want to retrieve supID, supName, supCity, supCountry, catPrice, catQuantity, prtID, prtName, and prtColor. The following SQL SELECT query and SPARQL query retrieve a result set using the relational or the RDF data model respectively.\nCode.17 - SQL query: sort Catalog prices for a Red Fire Hydrant Cap\nSELECT suppliers.sid, suppliers.sname, suppliers.scountry, catalog.catcost, catalog.catqnt, parts.pid, parts.pname, parts.pcolor FROM suppliers INNER JOIN (parts INNER JOIN [catalog] ON parts.pid = catalog.catpid) ON suppliers.sid = catalog.catsid WHERE (( ( parts.pid ) = 998 )) ORDER BY catalog.catcost; Code.18 - SPARQL query: sort Catalog prices for a Red Fire Hydrant Cap\nSELECT ?sup ?supName ?supCountry ?catPrice ?catQuantity ?prt ?prtName ?prtColor ?cat where { ?prt dc:identifier \u0026#34;998\u0026#34;^^xsd:int . ?prt rdf:label ?prtName . ?prt schema:color ?prtColor . ?cat wd:hasPart ?prt . ?cat schema:cost ?catPrice OPTIONAL {?cat schema:quantity ?catQuantity .} ?cat wd:hasVendor ?sup . ?sup rdf:label ?supName . ?sup schema:country ?supCountry } ORDER BY ASC(?catPrice) Code. 19 - We have coded two solutions for the testing case using our DBAPI OrientR3S3 package. In the first one (see condensed form in Code20) Catalog Tuples are filtered then sorted with a single command ! The first tuple in the resulting set is the one we are looking for. Then we use filtering on Part and Supplier sets to obtain other information. Finally we project and we Join all three tuples deleting any duplicates. In the second solution we start by filtering Catalog collections, then we find the Datum with the minimum Catalog price. Then we filter Catalog, Supplier and Part tuples, we project and join the final tuples.\nView Code Frame {: .btn .btn\u0026ndash;small}\nCode.20 R3DM/S3DM Filtering. This is the condensed version of Code.19\n{SUP, PRT, CAT} = OR3getAnything[from-\u0026gt;spcModel, get-\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Entities\u0026#34;] prtID = OR3getAnything[from-\u0026gt;spcModel, find-\u0026gt;\u0026#34;prtID\u0026#34;][[1]] fval1 = OR3getAnything[from-\u0026gt;prtID, find-\u0026gt;\u0026#34;998\u0026#34;][[1]] minCatPriceTuple = SortBy[ OR3getAnything[from-\u0026gt;CAT, get-\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Tuples\u0026#34;, filter-\u0026gt;fval1], OR3getValue@#[[3]] \u0026amp;][[1]] catTuple = minCatPriceTuple // OR3getValue fval2 = minCatPriceTuple[[1]] supTuple=OR3getAnything[from-\u0026gt;SUP, get-\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Tuples\u0026#34;, filter-\u0026gt;fval2, values-\u0026gt;True,][[1]] prtTuple=OR3getAnything[from-\u0026gt;PRT, get-\u0026gt;\u0026#34;Tuples\u0026#34;, filter-\u0026gt;fval1, values-\u0026gt;True,][[1]] prtTuple[[1 ;; 3]]~Join~catTuple[[3 ;; 4]]~Join~supTuple[[{1, 2, 5}]] // DeleteDuplicates Case2: Condition and Cleansing This is a case of detecting and correcting an inaccurate value from a record set that is returned by specifying a condition.\nCode. 21 - This is an example of cleansing in two phases, detection and correction. Here we can spot the error by filtering collection sets with the condition prtName=Acme Widget Washer. There are two values in prtUnit collection kg and kb. The second one should be kg, it is a typographical error. We can fix this by deleting the hyperlink that connects the nexus 52:3 (red hyperbond), with the datum kb (green hyperatom), and then adding a new hyperlink from 52:3 to datum 64:1.\nView Code Frame {: .btn .btn\u0026ndash;small}\nCase3: Graph Traversal This is how we perform graph traversal in R3DM/S3DM. Instead of visiting each vertex in the graph we filter hyperbonds on account of the hyperatoms they share.\nCode. 22 - We start by specifying a condition, e.g. visiting a single hyperatom. This is a green node on the first hypergraph with the label Acme Widget Washer. Now we can get hyperbonds (red nodes) and find all its siblings. This is also a visual representation of Part tuples. There are two Part items with the description Acme Widget Washer. One has Silver color, the other is Red and both of them weigh 142.88kg. In the same hypergraph we have also two identifiers 993 and 994 these are prtID Attribute values that are shared with Catalog Entity tuples. Therefore in the second hypergraph we have filtered Catalog tuples and we have drawn three of them that are related to these two Part items. This time there are common hyperatoms, those with a supplier identifier (1081, 1084), that are shared between Catalog and Supplier. In the third hypergraph we get a complete 360 degrees view of our case by filtering the Supplier Entity. Now we can see that there are two Suppliers one located in USA that supplies both Part items and the other in UK that supplies only the Silver Acme Widget Washer.\nView Code Frame\nIn all three cases we have demonstrated that there are two ways to present the resulting data set from filtering. We can either return item collections, i.e. sets of values for each Attribute we are interested in, or projected tuples from each Entity separately or in a consolidated multi-grid flat form.\nSummary We have presented R3DM/S3DM data modeling framework from a multi-perspective view. The building blocks of conceptual and logical perspective are paired up. Types are separated from instances and semantics are defined and explained with three alternative paradigms object-oriented, network graph and semiotics. It is the interpreted, encoded (materialized) and representative forms in the triangle of reference that gave R3DM/S3DM its name. This trilateral principle is applied to everything including the architectural design of R3DM/S3DM.\nThe eight type systems of R3DM/S3DM play the role of a formal upper level ontology and its construction is based on the Neurorganon Upper Level Ontology (NULON). Terms of this ontology describe the framework with a hierarchical organizational structure that defines schemata and types for models, entities, attributes, items, values, data sources, links and database metadata.\nIn terms of querying and managing data there is a set of functional operations that match SQL Select, Insert, Update, Delete statements and there is a filtering mechanism implemented which is equivalent to SQL Where conditions. Thanks to the powerful Wolfram Language transformations we can return results in the form of a table, Rule set, Association set, Dataset, or even a network graph. R3DM/S3DM has also been defined as a functional representation of information resources that are mapped to a materialized form (realization).\nEpilogue R3DM/S3DM is an attempt to unify existing popular data models. The key element to achieve this is the association construct. We have devoted five posts of this series to highlight differences and similarities of Relational, Topic Map, Property Graph, RDF and Qlik data models that are dependent on associations. And the innovative aspect of R3DM/S3DM is that it avoids namespace, addressing, and identification problems by adopting a uniform representation of everything with numerical vector references.\nR3DM/S3DM is a framework to construct a Reference Database Management System, it is RDBMS redefined. The first class citizen in this system is the Reference. It is not the tuple of Entity-Relationship data model, or the triplet of RDF/OWL data model, or even the nodes and edges of the graph data model. R3DM/S3DM is based on Atomic Information Reference units (AIR) and it can assimilate table, column, tuple, key-value, triplet, associations and graph data structures. This kind of granularity of R3DM/S3DM controls also the level of information detail that will be presented to the user e.g. show only hyperbonds i.e. Entity instances.\nInformation resources are not handled by name in R3DM/S3DM, they are always represented and function as meaningful keys (numerical vectors). We escape from the namespace entanglement and alleviate the complexity of linked data by smart AIR units that are represented in a uniform way and their digital form can be processed, retrieved and stored efficiently and/or combined to create composite information structures. Where bit is the basic construction unit for data, AIR becomes the fundamental processing unit for structured information. It is now possible to have a giant global graph (GGG) network of information resources based on the power of semiosis with a reference mechanism that is not built with character strings (URL) but it is similar to the Internet Protocol address (IP).\nThis is our mantra, build valuable relations; establish effective communications.\nThe End \u0026hellip; or perhaps the beginning of a new era in databases and data modeling.\nCross-References  LinkedIn - 20170412 Update about duration, effort and acknowledgements LinkedIn - 20170412 Article LinkedIn - 20170412 Update about LinkedIn article and request for comments LinkedIn - 20170426 Update about RDF predicate and literal triplets LinkedIn - 20170525 Update and comment - Post of Theodore Hills - \u0026ldquo;Data Architecture COMN Sense: Relationships and Semantics\u0026rdquo; LinkedIn - 20170525 Data Modeling Group - Relational-Graph DBMS, how do we bridge the gap ?
