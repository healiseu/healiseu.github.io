  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;back-to-the-roots&#34;&gt;Back to the roots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I realized that the &lt;strong&gt;associative, semiotic, hypergraph&lt;/strong&gt;, or in short the &lt;a href=&#34;https://healis.eu/en/post/20170412/&#34;&gt;R3DM/S3DM&lt;/a&gt;, technology framework we propose to be adopted in database management systems can be considered in many ways an extension to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_F._Codd&#34;&gt;Codd&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_model&#34;&gt;Relational Model&lt;/a&gt;. I am aware that this is a big claim and certainly this is not the place or the time to lay down my arguments, suffice it to say how this occurred to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have partially implemented &lt;a href=&#34;https://healis.eu/en/project/triadb/&#34;&gt;TRIADB&lt;/a&gt; technology twice on top of two different &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_store&#34;&gt;data stores&lt;/a&gt; and I noticed that those &lt;strong&gt;add and get operations&lt;/strong&gt; we defined are closely related to Codd&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra&#34;&gt;relational algebra operations&lt;/a&gt;, while data sets, i.e. domains, and a user defined type system match the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)&#34;&gt;sets defined in mathematics&lt;/a&gt; and relational theory. Coincidentally Codd&amp;rsquo;s Relational logic goes back to Aristotle and the corner stone of our technology, which is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://healis.eu/en/project/r3dm/#computational-semiotic-triangle&#34;&gt;computational semiotic triangle&lt;/a&gt;, goes back to Aristotle too. I will briefly mention that one basic difference is that both the heading set and the body tuples of the Relation, in fact everything, are transformed and uniformly represented with numerical key references. Therefore it can also be called &lt;strong&gt;Reference Database Management System (RDBMS)&lt;/strong&gt;. All these are simply good indications. I believe we are on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is, and I will quote &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_J._Date&#34;&gt;Chris Date&lt;/a&gt; here, that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;if you are proposing to replace technology A by technology B first is counted on you to understand technology A and then it is counted on you that there is some problem that technology A does not solve and technology B does solve&lt;/em&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the best person I have found to teach me Relational database technology, so that I can acquire an in-depth understanding, is Chris Date himself. The following video is a clip from an excellent, &lt;a href=&#34;http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030553.do&#34;&gt;illuminating workshop that explains Codd&amp;rsquo;s Relational Theory&lt;/a&gt; to computer professionals, but most importantly, he shows what a real relational product would be like, and how and why it would be so much better than what’s currently available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/qx0F7TfA8CI&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;relational-model-vs-other-data-models&#34;&gt;Relational model vs Other data models&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, allow me to have my doubts about whether many of the proponents of other database technologies, including those in SQL databases and those in NoSQL databases, have understood what are really the differences with respect to Relational model and at what abstraction level they occur. Again this is not the place or time to elaborate on this. Instead, I am inviting you to ponder on the architectural design of modern database management systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see in practice, it is too difficult to make a very clean separation between the physical, logical and conceptual levels of information. From an engineer&amp;rsquo;s point of view it is hard to separate theoretical from practical purposes. Moreover, many of these NoSQL DBMS, that are in fashion nowadays, are suited to solve a particular type of problem and this is why you often hear that big corporations and large companies have many different kinds of DBMS at the back-end. Not to mention that nowadays there is the trend to market many DBMS as multi-model database systems. And that made me also to realize that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;there has to be a distinction between those problems that one solves at the physical level e.g. physical layout, partition and availability and those that apply more at the logical-conceptual level e.g. integrity and data modeling. Therefore, I foresee that in the future systems will have to use a combination of these two levels that somehow will have to be tuned and made to work harmonically independent of each other&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-perspective&#34;&gt;Our perspective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is our perspective towards the architectural design of modern database management systems that fully justifies our choice of &lt;strong&gt;marketing TRIADB as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware&#34;&gt;middleware&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. We are focusing to provide an &lt;strong&gt;efficient and effective solution at the logical and conceptual level&lt;/strong&gt; using an existing implementation of the database physical layer. Relational modeling theory applies here too, from what I understand it was the implementation details at the physical level and perhaps other naive simplifications that made many to depart from the original Relational model. So it&amp;rsquo;s time to return back to the roots and make some real progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you, as a reader, have the same feelings and see some truth on my writing, I would be more than happy to discuss with you about the progress we are making with TRIADB and associative, semiotic, hypergraph technology and definitely exchange ideas and share some common thoughts on these database topics. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Topic Maps and RDF/OWL exhibit signs of aging. In my opinion these signs do not indicate maturity levels but on the contrary they signal a re-examination of the data modeling, information representation problem. There is an emergent need to unify and exchange transformations between serialization formats (XML, JSON, etc), (graph) DBMS data model standards and semantic web data models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence this is my speech at European Wolfram Technology Conference 2017 about a new data modeling framework &lt;a href=&#34;https://healis.eu/en/post/20170412/&#34;&gt;R3DM/S3DM&lt;/a&gt; that is implemented on top of OrientDB graph database and coded in Wolfram Mathematica.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/BZleqH7iMng&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;comparison-with-other-data-model-standards&#34;&gt;Comparison with other data model standards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are a few critical points to consider when you compare this data model with Topic Maps and RDF/OWL:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;namespace-problem&#34;&gt;Namespace problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both RDF/OWL and Topic Maps are suffering from namespace problems and complexity. In topic maps for example, when you want to define associations, i.e. n-ary relations, relationships you must specify at least type and roles. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Part(08:pid, &amp;quot;Acme Widget Washer&amp;quot;:pname, white:pcolor )&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in this representation you do not have a handle for the association instance and the context of roles has always to be present to assign meaning on values. Things become even more complicate with RDF association (type or instance) where everything has to be broken down in triples with labeled uni-directional edges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;(Prt1 --pid--&amp;gt; 08, Prt1 --pname--&amp;gt; &amp;quot;Acme Widget Washer&amp;quot;, Prt1 --pcolor--&amp;gt; white}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The predicate of RDF triplet is causing more harm than good. Any SPARQL traversal algorithm is heavily dependent on these predicates, and in practice for large collaborative knowledge bases, e.g. Freebase, they used to label both directions to make traversal easier. You may also consider that owl:sameAs adds more complexity in the graph and traversal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now compare these with the simplicity of Entity-Relationship model. The database vocabulary has the header of the association (relation) and the body contains tuples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;tuple type      : (pid, pname, pcolor)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;tuple instance  : (08, &amp;quot;Acme Widget Washer&amp;quot;, white)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there an alternative representation to combine these ? Yes there is, you make a &lt;strong&gt;uniform numerical representation&lt;/strong&gt; of types and instances, of entities and attributes, of data values and data types and you bind everything in a hypergraph space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;tuple type     : 233:0{85:0, 91:0, 34:0}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;tuple instance : 233:1[85:6, 91:2, 34:9]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vocabulary of relational model (header) permits to have &lt;strong&gt;ordered tuples&lt;/strong&gt; of values (body), the numerical reference vectors of R3DM/S3DM model permits to have &lt;strong&gt;unordered tuples&lt;/strong&gt; and there is a handle that represents each tuple instance. In RDF to represent a tuple you have to break it down into triples where you repeat the &lt;code&gt;subject&lt;/code&gt;. And values (&lt;code&gt;objects&lt;/code&gt;) &lt;strong&gt;must be semantically accompanied by the predicate&lt;/strong&gt;. Thus R3DM/S3DM associative representation with numerical references is simpler and it proves to be more efficient with indexing too !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;separate-abstraction-layers&#34;&gt;Separate abstraction layers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to separate digital information resources, e.g. web pages, files, folders, audio/video recordings, images, text documents etc from real things e.g. humans, organizations, objects, etc. It is also important to distinguish between a flexible model and its instances. But it is equally or more important to separate any abstract concept from data values (numerical, string, bits, etc). Because the first is the vehicle for human thinking and the second is the way computers are processing data. Therefore this gap has to be bridged somehow. R3DM/S3DM achieves this with an extra abstraction layer where everything is connected with &lt;a href=&#34;https://healis.eu/en/post/20150320/&#34;&gt;Atomic Information Resource&lt;/a&gt; (AIR) units. This AIR unit defines also the level of granularity. Instead of building everything with Topics, you use AIR units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;granularity-with-air-units&#34;&gt;Granularity with AIR units&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the AIR unit has the advantage that can be indexed easily, it is represented with a numerical vector, an address that can pinpoint the exact location of an Entity-Attribute-Value item. It is similar to an IPv4 address of a machine (e.g. domain, network, server, node/device/machine). My question is the following. &lt;span class=&#34;markup-quote&#34;&gt;If we use such addresses for connecting machines on the internet, why don&amp;rsquo;t we establish a similar standard for connecting data ?&lt;/span&gt; An AIR unit is the fundamental powerful construction unit for smart data. It knows its siblings, its parent, its type, its nexus, its associated AIR units (nodes). A tuple of such units can stand on its own, without a header and its completely meaningful because the context has already been defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;filtering-instead-of-querying&#34;&gt;Filtering instead of querying&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the uniform representation of everything with AIR units that are connected with bidirectional edges there is no need to define a query language but instead you define powerful functional operations that filter and add data in an associative manner in a fully typed environment. R3DM/S3DM supports types for database metadata, data sources, models, entity types, attribute types, items (instances), link types and value types. Again everything is constructed with AIR units. Both bidirectional edges and a full type system that is based on primitives were key features of Metadata Freebase project and then Google&amp;rsquo;s knowledge graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-solid-theoretical-background&#34;&gt;A solid theoretical background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R3DM/S3DM data model is founded on the theory of semiosis. There have been attempts to connect RDF/OWL with Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s triangle of reference/meaning but in my opinion they fail to capture the essence of the abstraction mechanism in semiosis which is played by the sign as the vehicle of communication between the signifier and the signified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summarize&#34;&gt;Summarize&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize the power of R3DM/S3DM is hidden on its Atomic Information Resource units that are fully typed, addressable and can be dereferenced and the formation of n-ary bidirectional associations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cross-references&#34;&gt;Cross-References&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurorganon Upper Level Ontology (NULON) is a top-level ontology also known as a foundation ontology. It includes a list of very general terms grouped in ontological distinct categories , such as &lt;code&gt;address&lt;/code&gt; , &lt;code&gt;agent&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;artifact&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;device&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;document&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;space&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;time&lt;/code&gt; and many others. These categories determine the most fundamental and the broadest classes of information resources. In NULON members of each class, i.e. vocabulary terms, preserve the same meaning across more specific knowledge domains and other reference work. In that aspect it is similar to a thesaurus because it groups together terms in disjoint collections of mostly similar concepts and it is like a dictionary because it can also include multiple, multi-lingual definitions. It is also an ontology because it defines relations and properties that describe how the terms can be linked together or bind them to web, computerized information resources. NULON recent version, numbers more than 500 core vocabulary terms grouped in 47 maximally disjoint categories. All these terms have been consistently mapped to standard definitions from at least two major reference works in the realm of semantically linked data; OpenCyc and Wikipedia. Respectively their information resources are used as identifiers and references for NULON terms. Most important, at this stage of architectural design what makes NULON really different from other Upper-Level Ontologies is the kind of grouping of the terms and the categories included and described in the οntology. This is the result of a big effort, the whole year, from a single person, to discover and organize efficiently most terms related to information technology, including abstraction, management, computer programming, data storage, metadata, data modeling, identity, reference, design patterns, web use, digital resources and devices to name a few of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;from-neuron-to-nulon&#34;&gt;From NEURON to NULON&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A computer is a general purpose, programmable electronic device, for storing and processing data. From the era of personal computers to the age of mobile devices, we are storing data into files and web pages. We are processing electronic documents with myriads of formats. We organize our file collections into hierarchies with folders. We use them to share information. So far the digital document is the main vehicle of information exchange and at the same time the obstacle for effective management of information and interconnection of information systems. Information technology industry is still waiting for the promised revolution in terms of web software and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This partly happened with Web 2.0, the social collaborative user environment that made the need to escape from the document centric computing more urgent. The published content has to be independent of the container so that it can be viewed in many alternative ways and combined easily in many forms. In all these years of computing evolution, there is very little that has been achieved to bridge the gap that exists between the presentation of information to the user and the storage of information on the computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if we could unify and standardize the processing of information from the lowest level of storing data up to the highest level of consuming the data as interconnected pipeline services. Then the flow of information, the interoperability of services and the communication among users can be achieved by defining a new kind of data abstraction that will enhance and gradually replace the electronic document. This is the information resource/reference (IR) a term that is so confused and obscure in Semantic Web technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now start drawing the analogy from computer networks to neural networks. IR is the fundamental unit of processing similar to “neuron”, and the Neurorganon project has already implemented IR in NULON (Neurorganon Upper Level Ontology), a solid theoretical framework that is the foundation for linking concepts together and attaching binary information resources (BIRs). With NULON we can model any kind of data as a graph with nodes (IRs) and edges (associations) and store permanently the network of information in state of the art database management systems that are also based in graphs, the perfect marriage for data modeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most important, with NULON it is now possible to reuse, redesign, repurpose, recombine and interconnect existing software tools for extraction, integration, transformation and visualization of information. Tools will be commercialized, or offered for free, as services and will be used to connect NULON to Web Browser Applications and Graph databases. Eventually we foresee the empowerment of a user with a decentralized network of services that will place him or his community group in charge of a personalized, specialized knowledge graph that will be tailored to his needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, with respect to organized information, new browsing methods will appear on the web. These will be present in the form of linked autonomous networks of concepts that will be either automatically created or semi-automatically designed by the expert user again with the help of software as a service. There has to be control for the level of detail and the depth of information, as well as a highly interactive environment to experiment with the visualization of data and the various templates that will assist in the dissemination of information from and to the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arguably the most challenging aspect on this kind of megaproject is to make the user to feel in a natural and comfortable way as it is most often the case when he is browsing the internet or when he sends an email to a friend. One has to experience the new environment and the services in relation to other internet users and tasks that he/she is already accustomed to accomplishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team behind the Neurorganon/NULO project will be aligned with that scope in mind, and the experience and skills of the members involved will eventually guarantee a mature and viable technology and methodology that will lead the development of new generation products and services in the information technology industry.&lt;/p&gt;
