  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally IT people including architects, engineers, scientists and developers are forced to think a particular implementation of an application or a business solution in terms of the query language. Generally speaking most often it is the specific technology and infrastructure behind the scene that dictates how things should be done. Recently the first workshop on web standardization for graph data was held in Berlin, Germany. The title of the workshop &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/Data/events/data-ws-2019/cfp.html&#34;&gt;Creating Bridges: RDF, Property Graph and SQL&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; indicates that it is technology again, and its vendors, that force a narrow view of how to apply graph networks in data management. Hope they do not seek a solution that temporarily makes everyone happy in business, instead of taking a firm decision to move ahead on a new path that will be proven the right choice over time. That said, I do recognize that there are always compatibility issues with older technology in place but the bridges should serve the scope of a smooth transition from the old age to the new age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-new-brave-age-of-hyperlinked-data&#34;&gt;The new brave age of hyperlinked data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is another factor more important than technology, the need to provide a business insight, understanding and/or solution to real world problems with increasing complexity. After all many recognize that this was the driving force behind the NoSQL movement that started ten years ago. Out of the three main technological categories of database products, key-value, document-hierarchical and graph networks, the last one emerged with significant importance for the future of IT business for many reasons that will not be analysed here. Suffice to say that WWW, the most advanced and popular information system, is the biggest graph network of documents and other resources in the history of human mankind. Today we reached the point in time that the maturity of NoSQL movement met the evolution of WWW but the question remains on how exactly these two will be married to serve human needs. A quick and sort answer is by &lt;strong&gt;hyperlinking data in the context of information&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;technical-questions-for-hyperlinking-data&#34;&gt;Technical questions for hyperlinking data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore the aim has been set but the competitive database, semantic and web technologies out there makes it too difficult for many to rise above the specifics. That is where a &lt;a href=&#34;https://healis.eu/en/post/20170412/&#34;&gt;multi-layer perspective&lt;/a&gt; is needed to embrace the problem of hyperlinking data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this mean users are going to abandon their favorite popular SQL row-based, column-based, document based or existing triple store and property graph databases ? No, not at all but this new technology should integrate them in the large picture which takes on account the following questions as it concerns the hyperlinked graph data network :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;physical-layer&#34;&gt;Physical Layer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although many vendors consider a native graph network storage layer as an advancement in graph databases, this approach has the following drawbacks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it results in poor data locality and you may consider this issue independent of horizontal scaling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you are forced to apply too early a graph layout on data especially on record-based data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is not easy to implement quick and easy data transformations, i.e. the result from a data query in a tabular, columnar, hierarchical or graph network format. All four are needed for different purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what is the best type of storage engine that serves these specifications ?&lt;/strong&gt; Would it be better to think in terms of a hybrid architecture ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;logical-layer&#34;&gt;Logical Layer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where the basic constructs of the technology must be thoroughly specified. Since we are talking about a graph network:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What type of nodes and edges we have ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you allow key-value properties in nodes and edges ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does the edge connect only two nodes ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What type of cardinality and linkage, i.e. unidirectional, bidirectional, they have ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking about linkage, both &lt;strong&gt;RDF and property graph databases are anchored on appropriate semantic labelling of edges&lt;/strong&gt; and then storage and retrieval of information at the implementation level are dependent on this labelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, have you considered that this extra piece of information, i.e. the label, in most cases can be a meta-data property of the node, e.g. type, category, role, characteristic, etc ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For that reason labelling of edges should be left to the data modeller, business person, purely for conceptualising the business model. Here is perhaps the most critical question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you use these constructs to build business data models and what are their semantics ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads us inadvertently to the conceptual level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conceptual-layer&#34;&gt;Conceptual layer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think RDF graphs and labeled property graphs and Topic Map graphs (hardly anyone talks anymore about this standard) and even entity-relationship graph in relational theory have varying types of constructs with big differences in meaning and use. Entities, attributes, properties, data resources, relationships, relations, associations, items, instances and many other concepts make the IT babel at the business, end-user level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here lies a major source of confusion for the newcomer, I used to be one of them, which is the &lt;strong&gt;distinction between classes and instances, metadata and data, terminological and assertion components&lt;/strong&gt;. This distinction as many others in IT semantic world is artificial, nevertheless it plays an extremely important role in programming, in data retrieval and even in inferencing mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think you can handle this distinction easily, I urge you to think again, because in my opinion these two concepts must be clearly separable and at the same time they have to be related like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://healis.eu/en/post/20190624/&#34;&gt;hand mold and the letter types in typography&lt;/a&gt;. On the contrary I do not see this happening in our modern graph technologies, time does not permit to expand this argument but it is entangled with the following important observation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;by-reference-vs-by-value&#34;&gt;By reference vs. by value&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those of us familiar with programming and the internals of computing know that there is another critical, fundamental distinction in data processing. &lt;strong&gt;How do you access the datum by reference or by value ?&lt;/strong&gt;_ This was the moment in time that RDF/OWL framework presented the first signs of derailment. First they came up with the idea of universal resource locator (URL), then the concept was elevated to the universal resource identifier (URI) and the result was the web identity crisis for those old enough to remember &lt;a href=&#34;https://ontopia.net/topicmaps/materials/identitycrisis.html&#34;&gt;the clash with the proponents of Topic Maps data modeling framework&lt;/a&gt;. If you ask me, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/content/semantic-web-identity-crisis-search-trivialities-never-were&#34;&gt;that crisis has not been resolved yet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason behind web identity crisis is the use of namespace addressing, to connect, identify and locate data. The notion of web address has been semantically overloaded because of its textual form. On the contrary internet protocol for addressing and usually primary key mechanism of databases are numerical. Perhaps they thought that this way it would have been easier for developers and machines to do the linkage in the same way they use HTML anchoring. But I guess this is more or less a fallacy of TimBL&amp;rsquo;s linked data network where it was designed primarily for documents (html pages) not record-base (relational) data. The origin of this misconception is &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex&#34;&gt;Memex&lt;/a&gt; and it is continued in our days with the invention of many different encodings, including RDFa, Microdata and JSON-LD with the intention of generating manual or semi-automated linked data in semi-structured, hierarchical forms and html documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global Giant Graph (GGG) or WWW 3.0 will become a reality only if W3C consortium admit that they have to build likewise IP numerical addressing schema for concepts in data models and for hyperlinked data. It is this new protocol that will permit networking at semantic level, it is going to be the same protocol that we are going to use for identification purposes, the same protocol that will make each data element traceable and connectable, the same protocol that will be used in number-crunching computers. Moreover the whole process of constructing hyperlinked data, especially from structured data resources (databases), will be fully automated and hidden in the same way TCP/IP is hidden from internet users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epilogue
The reader may realize that I have only touched various parts of the &amp;ldquo;elephant in the room&amp;rdquo;. But those key points that I tried to make digestible rose from my experience with semantic and database technologies and eventually from my long standing personal effort to develop &lt;a href=&#34;https://healis.eu/en/s3dm/&#34;&gt;S3DM/R3DM&lt;/a&gt; computational semiotics framework. This way I hope that I managed to enlighten a different path not in theory but in practice. And if there is one thing to remind you something from this article and assist you in following this path then let it be &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://healis.eu/en/post/20190624/&#34;&gt;granular computing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In computer science there are many things we take for granted like the fundamental digital representation of anything with 1s and 0s. It&amp;rsquo;s often too easy to forget that when you have dived deep into the virtual realm of a computer the only thing you get is a mere representation of abstract concepts. This is our data and because they live in a machine and its peripherals they always have structure no matter how you interpret them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;information&#34;&gt;Information&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that kind of human interpretation I will call it information, i.e. you put data in a form, in some perspective, so you can get meaning out of them. In that sense data in a computer does not differ much from printed letters in a book, or paint in a canvas, or stone in a sculpture. From that point of view computer is simply an advanced form of a medium, a sophisticated printing press where 0&amp;rsquo;s and 1&amp;rsquo;s take the place of the movable individual metal letters, i.e. a computerized movable type printing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conceptual-computational-semiotics-framework&#34;&gt;Conceptual, computational semiotics framework&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, it&amp;rsquo;s only structured data you have, our mind is doing all the rest because of the power of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiosis&#34;&gt;semiosis&lt;/a&gt;. One can also ask, is there anything in our universe that is unstructured ? Yes there is, concept is unstructured because it is an abstract thing. When you represent the concept, or you realize, materialize it in our realm then you have structure again. A computational model of representation which is semiotic in its nature is &lt;a href=&#34;https://healis.eu/en/s3dm/&#34;&gt;R3DM/S3DM&lt;/a&gt;. And here is a memorable type of formula that describes fully the semiotic nature of this data model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(R3DM): Representation ↦ Resource + Reference + Referent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(S3DM): Semantics ↦ Signifier + Sign + Signified&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;push-forward&#34;&gt;Push forward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays there is already a sufficient and effective solution for data volume and velocity. It&amp;rsquo;s variety and consequently integration that is at stake. In my opinion the key to an efficient and effective solution is to think about the exact form of what &lt;strong&gt;atomic fundamental constructs you use and how you build connected higher structures&lt;/strong&gt;. I think &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granular_computing&#34;&gt;granular computing&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent term we can use here. That said, I have experienced for more than a decade a denial of thinking a better data model standard than those we already have (Relational, RDF and Topic Maps) simply because many believe that the wheel is going to be reinvented. But progress is made only when one defies the established nomenclature and challenges them with a better alternative that can be proven in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_engineering&#34;&gt;computational scientific and engineering&lt;/a&gt; way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They’re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can’t do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#back-to-the-roots&#34;&gt;Back to the roots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#relational-model-vs-other-data-models&#34;&gt;Relational model vs Other data models&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#our-perspective&#34;&gt;Our perspective&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#cross-references&#34;&gt;Cross-References&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;back-to-the-roots&#34;&gt;Back to the roots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I realized that the &lt;strong&gt;associative, semiotic, hypergraph&lt;/strong&gt;, or in short the &lt;a href=&#34;https://healis.eu/en/post/20170412/&#34;&gt;R3DM/S3DM&lt;/a&gt;, technology framework we propose to be adopted in database management systems can be considered in many ways an extension to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_F._Codd&#34;&gt;Codd&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_model&#34;&gt;Relational Model&lt;/a&gt;. I am aware that this is a big claim and certainly this is not the place or the time to lay down my arguments, suffice it to say how this occurred to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have partially implemented &lt;a href=&#34;https://healis.eu/en/project/triadb/&#34;&gt;TRIADB&lt;/a&gt; technology twice on top of two different &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_store&#34;&gt;data stores&lt;/a&gt; and I noticed that those &lt;strong&gt;add and get operations&lt;/strong&gt; we defined are closely related to Codd&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra&#34;&gt;relational algebra operations&lt;/a&gt;, while data sets, i.e. domains, and a user defined type system match the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)&#34;&gt;sets defined in mathematics&lt;/a&gt; and relational theory. Coincidentally Codd&amp;rsquo;s Relational logic goes back to Aristotle and the corner stone of our technology, which is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://healis.eu/en/project/r3dm/#computational-semiotic-triangle&#34;&gt;computational semiotic triangle&lt;/a&gt;, goes back to Aristotle too. I will briefly mention that one basic difference is that both the heading set and the body tuples of the Relation, in fact everything, are transformed and uniformly represented with numerical key references. Therefore it can also be called &lt;strong&gt;Reference Database Management System (RDBMS)&lt;/strong&gt;. All these are simply good indications. I believe we are on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is, and I will quote &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_J._Date&#34;&gt;Chris Date&lt;/a&gt; here, that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;if you are proposing to replace technology A by technology B first is counted on you to understand technology A and then it is counted on you that there is some problem that technology A does not solve and technology B does solve&lt;/em&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the best person I have found to teach me Relational database technology, so that I can acquire an in-depth understanding, is Chris Date himself. The following video is a clip from an excellent, &lt;a href=&#34;http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030553.do&#34;&gt;illuminating workshop that explains Codd&amp;rsquo;s Relational Theory&lt;/a&gt; to computer professionals, but most importantly, he shows what a real relational product would be like, and how and why it would be so much better than what’s currently available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/qx0F7TfA8CI&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;relational-model-vs-other-data-models&#34;&gt;Relational model vs Other data models&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, allow me to have my doubts about whether many of the proponents of other database technologies, including those in SQL databases and those in NoSQL databases, have understood what are really the differences with respect to Relational model and at what abstraction level they occur. Again this is not the place or time to elaborate on this. Instead, I am inviting you to ponder on the architectural design of modern database management systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see in practice, it is too difficult to make a very clean separation between the physical, logical and conceptual levels of information. From an engineer&amp;rsquo;s point of view it is hard to separate theoretical from practical purposes. Moreover, many of these NoSQL DBMS, that are in fashion nowadays, are suited to solve a particular type of problem and this is why you often hear that big corporations and large companies have many different kinds of DBMS at the back-end. Not to mention that nowadays there is the trend to market many DBMS as multi-model database systems. And that made me also to realize that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;there has to be a distinction between those problems that one solves at the physical level e.g. physical layout, partition and availability and those that apply more at the logical-conceptual level e.g. integrity and data modeling. Therefore, I foresee that in the future systems will have to use a combination of these two levels that somehow will have to be tuned and made to work harmonically independent of each other&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-perspective&#34;&gt;Our perspective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is our perspective towards the architectural design of modern database management systems that fully justifies our choice of &lt;strong&gt;marketing TRIADB as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware&#34;&gt;middleware&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. We are focusing to provide an &lt;strong&gt;efficient and effective solution at the logical and conceptual level&lt;/strong&gt; using an existing implementation of the database physical layer. Relational modeling theory applies here too, from what I understand it was the implementation details at the physical level and perhaps other naive simplifications that made many to depart from the original Relational model. So it&amp;rsquo;s time to return back to the roots and make some real progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you, as a reader, have the same feelings and see some truth on my writing, I would be more than happy to discuss with you about the progress we are making with TRIADB and associative, semiotic, hypergraph technology and definitely exchange ideas and share some common thoughts on these database topics. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Topic Maps and RDF/OWL exhibit signs of aging. In my opinion these signs do not indicate maturity levels but on the contrary they signal a re-examination of the data modeling, information representation problem. There is an emergent need to unify and exchange transformations between serialization formats (XML, JSON, etc), (graph) DBMS data model standards and semantic web data models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence this is my speech at European Wolfram Technology Conference 2017 about a new data modeling framework &lt;a href=&#34;https://healis.eu/en/post/20170412/&#34;&gt;R3DM/S3DM&lt;/a&gt; that is implemented on top of OrientDB graph database and coded in Wolfram Mathematica.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/BZleqH7iMng&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;comparison-with-other-data-model-standards&#34;&gt;Comparison with other data model standards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are a few critical points to consider when you compare this data model with Topic Maps and RDF/OWL:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;namespace-problem&#34;&gt;Namespace problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both RDF/OWL and Topic Maps are suffering from namespace problems and complexity. In topic maps for example, when you want to define associations, i.e. n-ary relations, relationships you must specify at least type and roles. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Part(08:pid, &amp;quot;Acme Widget Washer&amp;quot;:pname, white:pcolor )&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in this representation you do not have a handle for the association instance and the context of roles has always to be present to assign meaning on values. Things become even more complicate with RDF association (type or instance) where everything has to be broken down in triples with labeled uni-directional edges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;(Prt1 --pid--&amp;gt; 08, Prt1 --pname--&amp;gt; &amp;quot;Acme Widget Washer&amp;quot;, Prt1 --pcolor--&amp;gt; white}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The predicate of RDF triplet is causing more harm than good. Any SPARQL traversal algorithm is heavily dependent on these predicates, and in practice for large collaborative knowledge bases, e.g. Freebase, they used to label both directions to make traversal easier. You may also consider that owl:sameAs adds more complexity in the graph and traversal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now compare these with the simplicity of Entity-Relationship model. The database vocabulary has the header of the association (relation) and the body contains tuples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;tuple type      : (pid, pname, pcolor)&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;tuple instance  : (08, &amp;quot;Acme Widget Washer&amp;quot;, white)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there an alternative representation to combine these ? Yes there is, you make a &lt;strong&gt;uniform numerical representation&lt;/strong&gt; of types and instances, of entities and attributes, of data values and data types and you bind everything in a hypergraph space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;tuple type     : 233:0{85:0, 91:0, 34:0}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;tuple instance : 233:1[85:6, 91:2, 34:9]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vocabulary of relational model (header) permits to have &lt;strong&gt;ordered tuples&lt;/strong&gt; of values (body), the numerical reference vectors of R3DM/S3DM model permits to have &lt;strong&gt;unordered tuples&lt;/strong&gt; and there is a handle that represents each tuple instance. In RDF to represent a tuple you have to break it down into triples where you repeat the &lt;code&gt;subject&lt;/code&gt;. And values (&lt;code&gt;objects&lt;/code&gt;) &lt;strong&gt;must be semantically accompanied by the predicate&lt;/strong&gt;. Thus R3DM/S3DM associative representation with numerical references is simpler and it proves to be more efficient with indexing too !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;separate-abstraction-layers&#34;&gt;Separate abstraction layers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to separate digital information resources, e.g. web pages, files, folders, audio/video recordings, images, text documents etc from real things e.g. humans, organizations, objects, etc. It is also important to distinguish between a flexible model and its instances. But it is equally or more important to separate any abstract concept from data values (numerical, string, bits, etc). Because the first is the vehicle for human thinking and the second is the way computers are processing data. Therefore this gap has to be bridged somehow. R3DM/S3DM achieves this with an extra abstraction layer where everything is connected with &lt;a href=&#34;https://healis.eu/en/post/20150320/&#34;&gt;Atomic Information Resource&lt;/a&gt; (AIR) units. This AIR unit defines also the level of granularity. Instead of building everything with Topics, you use AIR units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;granularity-with-air-units&#34;&gt;Granularity with AIR units&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the AIR unit has the advantage that can be indexed easily, it is represented with a numerical vector, an address that can pinpoint the exact location of an Entity-Attribute-Value item. It is similar to an IPv4 address of a machine (e.g. domain, network, server, node/device/machine). My question is the following. &lt;span class=&#34;markup-quote&#34;&gt;If we use such addresses for connecting machines on the internet, why don&amp;rsquo;t we establish a similar standard for connecting data ?&lt;/span&gt; An AIR unit is the fundamental powerful construction unit for smart data. It knows its siblings, its parent, its type, its nexus, its associated AIR units (nodes). A tuple of such units can stand on its own, without a header and its completely meaningful because the context has already been defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;filtering-instead-of-querying&#34;&gt;Filtering instead of querying&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the uniform representation of everything with AIR units that are connected with bidirectional edges there is no need to define a query language but instead you define powerful functional operations that filter and add data in an associative manner in a fully typed environment. R3DM/S3DM supports types for database metadata, data sources, models, entity types, attribute types, items (instances), link types and value types. Again everything is constructed with AIR units. Both bidirectional edges and a full type system that is based on primitives were key features of Metadata Freebase project and then Google&amp;rsquo;s knowledge graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-solid-theoretical-background&#34;&gt;A solid theoretical background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R3DM/S3DM data model is founded on the theory of semiosis. There have been attempts to connect RDF/OWL with Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s triangle of reference/meaning but in my opinion they fail to capture the essence of the abstraction mechanism in semiosis which is played by the sign as the vehicle of communication between the signifier and the signified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summarize&#34;&gt;Summarize&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize the power of R3DM/S3DM is hidden on its Atomic Information Resource units that are fully typed, addressable and can be dereferenced and the formation of n-ary bidirectional associations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cross-references&#34;&gt;Cross-References&lt;/h2&gt;
